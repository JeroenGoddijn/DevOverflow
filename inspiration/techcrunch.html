international money transfer service, is disclosing a new $292 million secondary round that sees investors value the company at $3.5 billion. That&#8217;s more than double the valuation <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https:\/\/crunchbase.com\/organization\/transferwise\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"transferwise\">TransferWise <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"><\/span><\/a> achieved in late 2017 at the time of its $280 million Series E round.<\/p>\n<p>The new secondly funding &#8212; with no new cash entering TransferWise&#8217;s balance sheet as a number of existing shareholders sell all or a portion of their holding &#8212; was led by growth capital investors <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https:\/\/crunchbase.com\/organization\/lead-edge-capital\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"lead-edge-capital\">Lead Edge Capital, <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"><\/span><\/a> Lone Pine Capital and <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https:\/\/crunchbase.com\/organization\/vitruvian-partners\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"vitruvian-partners\">Vitruvian Partners <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"><\/span><\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Existing investors Andreessen Horowitz and Baillie Gifford expanded their holdings in TransferWise, whilst investment was also provided from funds managed by BlackRock.<\/p>\n<p>In a call, TransferWise co-founder and chairman Taavet Hinrikus told me the round was oversubscribed, too. The arbitrary figure of $292 million was simply the result of how much liquidity existing shareholders were willing to make available, and nowhere near the upper level of interest.<\/p>\n<p>He also pointed out that existing institutional investors aren&#8217;t exiting during this round, with Andreessen Horowitz and Baillie Gifford actually doubling down somewhat. Instead, this liquidity event was mainly a way for TransferWise employees &#8212; existing and presumably former &#8212; to cash in on some or all of their stake. And for new later-stage investors to jump on-board.<\/p>\n<p>All of which &#8212; and at <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2017\/11\/01\/transferwise-280-million\/\">the risk of repeating myself<\/a> &#8212; would suggest that a potential TransferWise public offering is <em>still<\/em> a long way off yet, something that Hinrikus doesn&#8217;t refute. &#8220;Why would we go public?,&#8221; he says rhetorically, noting that the company is still growing fast and capital isn&#8217;t an issue.<\/p>\n<p>So why then in contrast are other fast-growing companies going public much earlier these days? &#8220;You&#8217;d have to ask them,&#8221; Hinrikus says, batting away my question in his usual laid back and matter-of-fact manner. Pressed a little harder, he says that one difference might be that TransferWise&#8217;s institutional investors aren&#8217;t (yet) pushing for a liquidity event on the scale of an IPO. As already noted, in some instances they are actually purchasing more shares in the company.<\/p>\n<p>Hinrikus also says the regulatory climate is now changing in TransferWise&#8217;s favour. In 2018, the EU voted to mandate the outlawing of exchange rate mark-ups on international payments through its Cross-Border Payments Regulations, something that the London fintech company has long been lobbying for. Australia is thought to be considering similar regulatory measures following an inquiry into the issue by the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission.<\/p>\n<p>To that end, TransferWise says it now serves 5 million customers worldwide, processing \u00a34 billion every month. Every year it estimates it saves customers \u00a31 billion in bank fees. The service currently supports 1,600 currency routes, and is available for 49 currencies.<\/p>\n<p>The company employs more than 1,600 people across 12 global offices and says it will hire 750 more people in the next 12 months. Audited financials for fiscal year ending March 2018 revealed 77% revenue growth to \u00a3117 million and a net profit of \u00a36.2 million after tax.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>TransferWise, the London-headquartered international money transfer service, is disclosing a new $292 million secondary round that sees investors value the company at $3.5 billion.

That proved to be eye-opening, but it was actually a Kickstarter project with a friend that truly opened his mind to the potential of building a new venture.<\/p>\n<p>Rahim assisted fellow USC classmate Sam Mazumdar with <a href=\"https:\/\/www.yathletics.com\/\">Y Athletics<\/a>, which raised more than $600,000 from the crowdsourcing site to develop &#8220;odor-resistant&#8221; sports attire that used silver within the fabric to repel the smell of sweat. The business has since expanded to cover underwear and socks, and it put Rahim&#8217;s mind to work on what he could do by himself.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;It blew my mind that you can build a brand from scratch,&#8221; he said. &#8220;If you are good at product design and branding, you could connect to a manufacturer, raise money from backers and get it to market.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>On his return to Bangladesh, he got Deligram off the ground in January 2017, although it didn&#8217;t open its doors to retailers and consumers until March 2018.<\/p>\n<h2>E-commerce through local stores<\/h2>\n<p>Deligram is an effort to emulate the achievements of Amazon in the U.S. and Alibaba in China. Both companies pioneered online commerce and turned the internet into a major channel for sales, but the young Bangladeshi startup&#8217;s early approach is very different from the way those now hundred-billion-dollar companies got started.<\/p>\n<p>Offline retail is the norm in Bangladesh and, with that, it&#8217;s the long chain of mom and pop stores that account for the majority of spending.<\/p>\n<p>That&#8217;s particularly true outside of urban areas, where such local stores almost become community gathering points, where neighbors, friends and families run into each other and socialize.<\/p>\n<p>Instead of disruption, working with what is part of the social fabric is more logical. Thus, Deligram has taken a hybrid approach that marries its regular e-commerce website and app with offline retail through mom and pop stores, which are known as &#8220;mudir dokan&#8221; in Bangladesh&#8217;s Bengali language.<\/p>\n<p>A customer can order their product through the Deligram app on their phone and have it delivered to their home or office, but a more popular &#8212; and oftentimes logical &#8212; option is to have it sent to the local mudir dokan store, where it can be collected at any time. But beyond simply taking deliveries, mudir dokans can also operate as Deligram retailers by selling through an agent model.<\/p>\n<p>That&#8217;s to say that they enable their customers to order products through Deligram even if they don&#8217;t have the app, or even a smartphone &#8212; although the latter is increasingly unlikely with smartphone ownership booming. Deligram is proactively recruiting mudir dokan partners to act as agents. It provides them with a tablet and a physical catalog that their customers can use to order via the e-commerce service. Delivery is then taken at the store, making it easy to pick up, and maintaining the local network.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll tell them: &#8216;Right now, you offer a few hundred products, now you have access to 15,000,&#8217; &#8221; the Deligram CEO said.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"embed-youtube embed breakout embed--video\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe class='youtube-player' type='text\/html' width='640' height='360' src='https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/fyW-T8VShf8?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;autohide=2&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;'><\/iframe><\/span><\/p>\n<p>Indeed, Rahim sees this new digital storefront as a key driver of revenue for mudir dokan owners. For Deligram, it is potentially also a major customer acquisition channel, particularly among those who are new to the internet and the world of smartphone apps.<\/p>\n<p>This offline-online model &#8212; known by the often-buzzy industry term &#8220;omnichannel&#8221; &#8212; isn&#8217;t new, but in a world where apps and messaging is prevalent, reaching and retaining users is challenging, particularly in emerging markets.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s not easy to direct people to a website today, and the app-first approach has made it hard,&#8221; Rahim said. &#8220;We looked at how companies in Indonesia and India overcame these challenges.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>In particular, he studied the work of Go-Jek in Indonesia, which uses an agent model to push its services to nascent internet users, and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/news\/features\/2018-10-18\/amazon-battles-walmart-in-indian-e-commerce-market-it-created\">Amazon India<\/a>, which leans heavily on India&#8217;s local &#8220;kirana&#8221; stores for orders and deliveries.<\/p>\n<p>In Deligram&#8217;s case, the mudir dokan picks up sales commission as well as money for every delivery that is sent to their store. Home deliveries are possible, but the lack of local infrastructure &#8212; &#8220;turn right at the blue house, left at the white one, and my place is third from the left,&#8221; is a common type of direction &#8212; makes finding exact locations difficult and inefficient, so an additional cost is charged for such requests.<\/p>\n<p>E-commerce startups often struggle with last-mile because they rely on a clutch of logistics companies to fulfill orders. In a rare move for an early-stage company, Deligram has opted to run its entire logistics process in-house. That obviously necessitates cost and likely provides significant growing pains and stress, but, in the long term, Rahim is betting that a focus on quality control will pay out through higher customer service and repeat buyers.<\/p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_1830408\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-1830408\" class=\"breakout wp-image-1830408 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/05\/E2A8196_1600x1067.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/05\/E2A8196_1600x1067.jpg 1600w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/05\/E2A8196_1600x1067.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/05\/E2A8196_1600x1067.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/05\/E2A8196_1600x1067.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/05\/E2A8196_1600x1067.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/05\/E2A8196_1600x1067.jpg?resize=50,33 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><p id=\"caption-attachment-1830408\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">A prospective Deligram customer flips through a hard copy of the company&#8217;s product brochure in a local store [Image via Deligram]<\/p><\/div><\/p>\n<h2>Startups on the rise in Bangladesh<\/h2>\n<p>Rahim&#8217;s timing is impeccable. He returned to Bangladesh just as technology was beginning to show the potential to impact daily life. Bangladesh has posted a 7% rise in GDP annually every year since 2016, and with an estimated 80 million internet users, it has the fifth-largest online population on the planet.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;We are\u00a0riding on a lot of macro trends; we&#8217;re among the top five based on GDP growth and have the world&#8217;s eighth-largest population,&#8221; Rahim told TechCrunch. &#8220;There are 11 million people in middle income &#8212; that&#8217;s growing &#8212; and our country has 90 million people aged under 30.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;An index to track the growth of young people would be [capital city] Dhaka\u2026 you can just see the vibrancy with young people using smartphones,&#8221; he added.<\/p>\n<p>That&#8217;s an ideal storm for startups, and the country has seen a mix of overseas entrants and local ventures pick up speed. <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2018\/05\/08\/alibaba-buys-rocket-internets-daraz\/\">Alibaba last year acquired Daraz<\/a>, the Rocket Internet-founded e-commerce service that covers Pakistan, Bangladesh, Myanmar, Sri Lanka and Nepal, while <a href=\"https:\/\/www.thedailystar.net\/business\/alibaba-buys-20pc-stake-bkash-1568293\">the Chinese giant also snapped up 20% of bKash<\/a>, a fintech venture started from Brac Bank as part of the regional expansion of its Ant Financial affiliate.<\/p>\n<p><a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https:\/\/crunchbase.com\/organization\/uber\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"uber\">Uber, <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"><\/span><\/a> too, is present, but it is up against tough local opposition, as is the norm in Asian markets.<\/p>\n<p>That&#8217;s because Bangladesh&#8217;s most prominent local startups are in ride-hailing. <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2018\/04\/27\/bangladeshs-version-of-go-jek-raises-over-10m-in-a-round-led-by-go-jek\/\">Pathao raised more than $10 million in a funding round<\/a> that closed last year and was led by Go-Jek, the Indonesia-based ride-hailing firm valued at more than $9 billion that&#8217;s backed by the likes of Tencent and Google. <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https:\/\/crunchbase.com\/organization\/pathao\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"pathao\">Pathao <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"><\/span><\/a> is reportedly on track to raise a $50 million Series B this year, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.dealstreetasia.com\/stories\/pathao-seriesb-gojek-133875\/\">according to Deal Street Asia<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_1629690\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-1629690\" class=\"breakout size-full wp-image-1629690\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/04\/pathao.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"546\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/04\/pathao.jpg 1696w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/04\/pathao.jpg?resize=150,80 150w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/04\/pathao.jpg?resize=300,160 300w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/04\/pathao.jpg?resize=768,410 768w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/04\/pathao.jpg?resize=680,363 680w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/04\/pathao.jpg?resize=50,27 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><p id=\"caption-attachment-1629690\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Pathao is one of two local companies that competes alongside Uber in Bangladesh [Image via Pathao]<\/p><\/div>Its chief rival is Shohoz, a startup that began in ticketing but expanded to rides and services on-demand. <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2018\/09\/23\/shohoz\/\">Shohoz raised $15 million<\/a> in a round led by Singapore&#8217;s Golden Gate Ventures, which was announced last year.<\/p>\n<p>Deligram has also pulled in impressive funding numbers, too.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/medium.com\/deligram\/deligram-raises-2-5m-to-supercharge-mudir-dokans-into-ecommerce-hubs-dd020d0530a6\">The startup announced a $2.5 million Series A raise<\/a> at the end of March, which Rahim wrote came from &#8220;a network of institutional and angel investors;&#8221; such is the challenge of finding a large check for a tech play in Bangladesh. The investors involved included Skycatcher, Everblue Management and Microsoft executive Sonia Bashir Kabir. A delighted Rahim also won a check from Rahimafrooz, the family business.<\/p>\n<p>That&#8217;s not a given, he said, admitting that his family did initially want him to go to work with their business rather than pursuing his own startup. In that context, contributing to the round is a major endorsement, he said.<\/p>\n<p>Rahimafrooz could be a crucial ally in future fundraising, too. Despite an improving climate for tech companies, Bangladesh&#8217;s top startups are still finding it tough to raise money, especially with overseas investors that can write the larger checks that are required to scale.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;I think the biggest challenge is branding. Every time I speak with new investors, I have to start by explaining where Bangladesh is, or the national metrics, not even our business,&#8221; Pathao CEO Hussain Elius told TechCrunch.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;There\u2019s a legacy issue. Bangladesh seems like a country which floods all the time and the garment sector going down \u2014 that\u2019s a part of the story but not the full story. It\u2019s also an incredible country that\u2019s growing despite those challenges,&#8221; he added.<\/p>\n<p>Pathao is reportedly on track to raise a $50 million Series B this year, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.dealstreetasia.com\/stories\/pathao-seriesb-gojek-133875\/\">according to Deal Street Asia<\/a>. Elius didn&#8217;t address that directly, but he did admit that raising growth funding is a bigger challenge than seed-based financing, where the Bangladesh government helps with its own fund and entrepreneurial programs.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;It\u2019s hard for us as we\u2019re the first ones out there, but it\u2019ll be easier for the ones who\u2019ll follow on,&#8221; he explained.<\/p>\n<p>Still, there are some optimistic overseas watchers.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;We remain enthusiastic about the rapidly expanding set of opportunities in Bangladesh,&#8221; said Hian Goh, founding partner of Singapore-based VC firm Openspace &#8212; which invested in Pathao.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;The country continues to be one of the fastest-growing economies in the world, underpinned by additional growth in its garments manufacturing sector. This has blossomed into an expanding middle class with very active consumption behavior,&#8221; Goh added.<\/p>\n<h2>Growth plans<\/h2>\n<p>With the pain of fundraising put to the side for now, the new money is being put to work growing the Deligram business and its network into more parts of Bangladesh, and the more challenging urban areas.<\/p>\n<p>Geographically, the service is expanding its agent reach into five more cities to give it a total of seven locations nationwide. That necessitates an increase in logistics and operations to keep up with, and prepare for, that new demand.<\/p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_1830411\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-1830411\" class=\"breakout wp-image-1830411 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/05\/E2A7631_1600x1067.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/05\/E2A7631_1600x1067.jpg 1600w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/05\/E2A7631_1600x1067.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/05\/E2A7631_1600x1067.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/05\/E2A7631_1600x1067.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/05\/E2A7631_1600x1067.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/05\/E2A7631_1600x1067.jpg?resize=50,33 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><p id=\"caption-attachment-1830411\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Deligram workers in one of the company&#8217;s warehouses [Image via Deligram]<\/p><\/div>Rahim said the company had handled 12,000 orders to date as of the end of March, but that has now grown past 20,000 indicating that order volumes are rising. He declined to provide financial figures, but said that the company is on track to increase its monthly GMV volume by six-fold by the end of this year. Electronics, phones and accessories are among its most popular items, but Deligram also sells apparel, daily items and more.<\/p>\n<p>Interestingly, and perhaps counter to assumptions, Deligram started in rural areas, where Rahim saw there was less competition but also potentially more to learn through a more early-adopter customer base. That&#8217;s obviously one major challenge when it comes to growth, and now the company is looking at urban expansion points.<\/p>\n<p>On the product side, Deligram is in the early stages of piloting consumer financing using its local store agents as the interface, while Rahim teased &#8220;exciting IOT R&amp;D projects&#8221; that he said are in the planning stage.<\/p>\n<p>Ultimately, however, he concedes that the road is likely to be a long one.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Over the last 18-20 years, modern retail hasn\u2019t made much progress here,&#8221; Rahim said. &#8220;It accounts for around 2.5% of total retail, e-commerce is below 1% and the long tail local stores are the rest.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;People will eventually shift, but I think it\u2019ll take five to eight years, which is why we provide the convenience via mom and pop shops,&#8221; he added.<\/p>\n<p><em>Update 05\/22 03:00 PDT: Corrected details about Rahimafrooz<\/em><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>At just 26, Waiz Rahim is supposed to be involved in the family business, having returned home in 2016 with an engineering degree from the University of Southern California.

Apple says that these boosts mean the 15\u201d MacBook Pro<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0<\/span>will run at double the speed of the previous quad-core models and hit 40% improvements over the 6-core MacBook Pro model.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Apple says this is its fastest Mac notebook ever.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Oh, and there is that keyboard update.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong>Speed bump<\/strong><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">The $2,399 config of the 15&#8243; MacBook Pro is getting a 2.6GHz 6-core i7 that boosts to 4.5ghz, a 400 MHz increase in turbo speed. The top end $2,799 config is now standard with an 8-core i9, two more cores and a 500 MHz increase over the current 6-core config.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">The 13&#8243; MacBook Pro with Touch Bar gets boosted 2.4GHz quad-core processors, standard, which will turbo boost to speeds up to 4.7GHz. The configure-your-own option gets a 200MHz bump, making it a full 2x faster from the dual-core 13\u201d.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">The speed boosts of the MacBook Pro and the keyboard changes come after a year of boosts for the flagship notebook. It got an update last July, a graphics update in October and now the i9 update. Amidst a shift in Apple\u2019s business driven by smartphone market saturation, the Mac has continued to grow out-sized to the industry and still acts as a beachhead for Apple in many enterprise businesses.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">The new MacBook Pro models will be available for purchase today.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong>About the keyboard<\/strong><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Apple also told me that it is making three announcements about the MacBook Pro keyboard situation. Unless you\u2019ve been under a rock, you\u2019re aware that the current generation of MacBook Pro (and MacBook Air) models <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2019\/03\/27\/apple-sorry-for-latest-macbook-keyboard-woes\/\">have had issues<\/a> with keys either <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2018\/09\/01\/an-ode-to-apples-awful-mac-keyboard\/\">not firing or firing twice<\/a>, resulting in no letter or double letters typed. The industry term for this is &#8220;make or double make.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Apple recently revised the MacBook keyboards quietly with the addition of a membrane that seemed intended to prevent dust and particulates from making it under the keys and preventing firing. The updates, though seemingly improvements, still resulted in some malfunctions. And, Apple never really even said they were making the change.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Today, however, they told me they\u2019re taking three explicit steps to help with the keyboard situation:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>The MacBook Pro keyboard mechanism has had a materials change in the mechanism. Apple says that this new keyboard mechanism composition will substantially reduce the double-type\/no-type issue. Apple will not specify what it has done, but doubtless tear-downs of the keyboard will reveal what has been updated.<\/li>\n<li>Though Apple believes this change will greatly reduce the issue, it is also including all butterfly keyboards across its notebook line in its <a href=\"https:\/\/www.apple.com\/support\/keyboard-service-program-for-macbook-and-macbook-pro\/\">Keyboard Service Program<\/a>. This means that current MacBook Pros and even the models being released today will have keyboard repairs covered at no cost, in warranty and out of warranty.<\/li>\n<li>Apple tells me that repair times for keyboards have been longer than they would like. It is making substantial improvements to repair processes in Apple Stores to make repairs faster for customers with issues.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p class=\"p1\">If you bring a MacBook in with an older third-generation (the one with the membrane) malfunctioning keyboard, it will be replaced with this new fourth revision of the MacBook keyboard. So if you have an Air or a Pro that has issues, it will get the new mechanism.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">As a note, the changes in the keyboards are &#8220;under the hood,&#8221; meaning they are not intended to change the look or feel of the keyboard and should result in the same typing experience as current-gen keyboards.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">The popularity of the MacBook Pro has only been highlighted by the keyboard issues, as no one notices a flaw in their tools more than people who live and die by them. If Apple is able to finally put the issues of this current generation of keyboards to rest it will have plugged a potential hole in MacBook sales and given itself breathing room to introduce a full new generation of the machines.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">This speed bump comes in advance of Apple\u2019s WWDC conference where it is anticipated to launch iOS 13 and other software products for consumers and developers. Apple has, at times, used the stage to announce hardware improvements as well. Its decision to announce this speed bump and keyboard fix now could be a result of its desire to &#8220;clear the decks&#8221; for announcements onstage at the conference, or a desire to address the keyboard fix &#8220;off air&#8221; \u2014 or both.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">WWDC is about a week and a bit away, and we\u2019ll be there on the ground to bring you the updates from the scene.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Apple is updating its 15\u201d MacBook Pro with new 8-core and 6-core processors and its 13\u201d MacBook Pro with Touch Bar with 8th-gen quad-core processors.

An order is an instruction from them to improve processes within a certain time frame. The order requires us to optimize existing processes to prevent money laundering and increase N26 staffing levels,\u201d the company says in <a href=\"https:\/\/n26.com\/en-de\/blog\/bafin-order-what-it-means-and-what-we-are-doing?utm_source=twitter&amp;medium=social&amp;utm_content=blog-post&amp;utm_term=bafin\">a blog post<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>A <a href=\"https:\/\/t3n.de\/news\/maengel-bei-n26-finanzaufsicht-mahnt-reformen-an-1155446\/\">few<\/a> <a href=\"https:\/\/www.tagesschau.de\/investigativ\/ndr\/geldwaesche-online-101.html\">articles<\/a> have highlighted a handful of cases of fraud in recent weeks. Customers tried to use N26 for money-laundering purposes. It took some time before N26 reacted and closed those accounts.<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s not that surprising given that literally every bank suffers from this issue. For instance, all the big French banks (BNP Paribas, Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole and Cr\u00e9dit Mutuel) <a href=\"https:\/\/www.cbanque.com\/banque\/actualites\/68852\/credit-mutuel-une-amende-pour-manquement-dans-la-lutte-contre-le-blanchiment\">have been fined<\/a> in the past for the same reason.<\/p>\n<p>Banking regulators don\u2019t review suspicious transactions directly. They make sure that banks have the right processes and teams to catch the vast majority of suspicious transactions.<\/p>\n<p>As N26 has more than 2.5 million users, it\u2019s been hard to scale its workforce appropriately. In other words, it has been short-staffed. In recent months, the company has been hiring customer support and anti-money laundering teams like crazy, by hiring more people directly and signing deals with subcontractors.<\/p>\n<p>BaFin asks N26 to catch up with its backlog of flagged transactions. The company plans to be done by the end of next week. BaFin also wants to see written descriptions of processes and workflows. Finally, the regulator says that N26 should recheck the identity of some customers and redo the KYC process (\u201cknow your customer\u201d). N26 says that it plans to implement BaFin\u2019s requirements before the deadline.<\/p>\n<p>Creating a startup is hard, but creating a bank with startup-like growth is even harder. Banking regulation is tough, and it\u2019s a good thing for N26 customers that BaFin is keeping an eye out. Let&#8217;s hope that today&#8217;s order is just a bump in the road.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Fintech startup N26 received an order from BaFin, the German banking regulator.

href=\"https:\/\/www.blog.google\/products\/search\/new-design-google-search\/\">unveiled<\/a> a new look for its mobile search results which gives sites a way to showcase their own branding, instead of looking like every other blue link. Before, the search results were blue and the source &#8212; a publisher&#8217;s site, for example &#8212; would appear below in a smaller, green font. Now, it&#8217;s the publisher who gets top billing. With the refresh, the source for the search result appears on top and includes the site&#8217;s own icon.<\/p>\n<p>The revamp is subtle, but one that will likely please publishers as it gives them a way to stand out. After all, web searchers who are already familiar with the publisher&#8217;s site may choose to click through (or rather, tap through) to their link out of a personal preference &#8212; even if it&#8217;s further down on the results page.<\/p>\n<p>In addition, the website branding can help web searchers better understand where the information is coming from &#8212; like an official site or well-known news publication, for example.<\/p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-1831219\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/05\/google-mobile-search-results.png?w=571\" alt=\"\" width=\"571\" height=\"680\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/05\/google-mobile-search-results.png 840w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/05\/google-mobile-search-results.png?resize=126,150 126w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/05\/google-mobile-search-results.png?resize=252,300 252w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/05\/google-mobile-search-results.png?resize=768,914 768w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/05\/google-mobile-search-results.png?resize=571,680 571w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/05\/google-mobile-search-results.png?resize=42,50 42w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 571px) 100vw, 571px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>The update also impacts how Google Search ads appear.<\/p>\n<p>Before, the word &#8220;Ad&#8221; would display in a small green box ahead of the source link. Now, the word &#8220;Ad&#8221; appears in a bolded, black font where the website icon would otherwise be. It&#8217;s a bit less noticeable that the top search results link is an ad because your eyes are drawn to the blue link &#8212; and because the word &#8220;Ad&#8221; no longer has a box around it.<\/p>\n<p>Google says the new design will help it prepare for the search changes ahead as it enables the company to add more action buttons and previews to the search result cards, while still retaining attribution back to the source.<\/p>\n<p>The company recently announced some of its plans for new search features at <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/tag\/google-i-o-2019\/\">Google I\/O<\/a> earlier this month, including <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2019\/05\/07\/google-brings-augmented-reality-to-search\/\">AR in search results<\/a>, as well as <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2019\/05\/07\/google-search-will-offer-better-news-coverage-and-soon-support-for-podcast-search\/\">better news coverage and support for podcast search<\/a>.

The exploit relies on the router&#8217;s default password to work, which many don&#8217;t change.<\/p>\n<p>In the worst case scnario, an attacker could target vulnerable devices on a massive scale, using similar mechanism to how botnets like Mirai worked \u2014 by scouring the web and hijacking routers using default passwords like &#8220;admin&#8221; and &#8220;pass&#8221;.<\/p>\n<p>Andrew Mabbitt, founder of U.K. cybersecurity firm Fidus Information Security, first <a href=\"https:\/\/fidusinfosec.com\/tp-link-remote-code-execution-cve-2017-13772\/\">discovered and disclosed<\/a> the remote code execution bug to TP-Link in October 2017. TP-Link released a patch a few weeks later for the vulnerable WR940N router, but Mabbitt warned TP-Link again in January 2018 that another router, TP-Link&#8217;s WR740N, was also vulnerable to the same bug because the company <a href=\"https:\/\/fidusinfosec.com\/a-curious-case-of-code-reuse-tplink-cve-2017-13772-v2\/\">reused vulnerable code<\/a> between devices.<\/p>\n<p>TP-Link said the vulnerability was <a href=\"https:\/\/www.tp-link.com\/us\/support\/faq\/2166\/\">quickly patched<\/a> in both routers. But when we checked, the firmware for WR740N wasn&#8217;t available on the website.<\/p>\n<p>When asked, a TP-Link spokesperson said the update was &#8220;currently available when requested from tech support,&#8221; but wouldn&#8217;t explain why.

At the heart of any network, any flaw affecting a router can have disastrous effects on every connected device. By gaining complete control over the router, Mabbitt said an attacker could wreak havoc on a network. Modifying the settings on the router affects everyone who&#8217;s connected to the same network, like altering the DNS settings to trick users into visiting a fake page to steal their login credentials.<\/p>\n<p>TP-Link declined to disclose how many potentially vulnerable routers it had sold, but said that the WR740N had been discontinued a year earlier in 2017. When we checked two search engines for exposed devices and databases, Shodan and Binary Edge, each suggested there are anywhere between 129,000 and 149,000 devices on the internet \u2014 though the number of vulnerable devices is likely far lower.<\/p>\n<p>Mabbitt said he believed TP-Link still had a duty of care to alert customers of the update if thousands of devices are still vulnerable, rather than hoping they will contact the company&#8217;s tech support.<\/p>\n<p>Both <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2019\/05\/01\/uk-connected-devices-security\/\">the U.K.<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2018\/10\/05\/california-passes-law-that-bans-default-passwords-in-connected-devices\/\">the U.S. state of California<\/a> are set to soon require companies to sell devices with unique default passwords to prevent botnets from hijacking internet-connected devices at scale and using their collective internet bandwidth to knock websites offline.<\/p>\n<p>The Mirai botnet <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2016\/10\/21\/many-sites-including-twitter-and-spotify-suffering-outage\/\">downed<\/a> Dyn, a domain name service giant, which knocked <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2016\/10\/21\/many-sites-including-twitter-and-spotify-suffering-outage\/\">dozens of major sites<\/a> offline for hours \u2014 including Twitter, Spotify and SoundCloud.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Read more:<\/strong><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2019\/05\/01\/uk-connected-devices-security\/\">UK plans new law aimed at improving Internet of Things security<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2018\/10\/05\/california-passes-law-that-bans-default-passwords-in-connected-devices\/\">California passes law that bans default passwords in connected devices<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2016\/10\/21\/many-sites-including-twitter-and-spotify-suffering-outage\/\">Large DDoS attacks cause outages at Twitter, Spotify, and other sites<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2019\/05\/10\/gps-trackers-flaw\/\">A popular GPS tracker leaks real-time locations<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2019\/02\/17\/we-take-your-privacy-and-security-seriously\/\">Stop saying, \u2018We take your privacy and security seriously\u2019<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2018\/12\/10\/equifax-breach-preventable-house-oversight-report\/\">Equifax breach was \u2018entirely preventable\u2019 had it used basic security measures<\/a><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Thousands of TP-Link routers are vulnerable to a bug that can be used to remotely take control the device, but it took over a year for the company to publish the patches on its website.

now at Google, is back today with the launch of a new game: <a href=\"http:\/\/emojishot.sayman.com\/\">Emojishot<\/a>, an emoji-based guessing game for iOS, built over the past ten weeks within Google&#8217;s in-house incubator, Area 120.<\/p>\n<p>The game, which is basically a version of charades using emoji characters, is notable because of its creator.<\/p>\n<p>By age 17, Sayman had <a href=\"https:\/\/itunes.apple.com\/us\/developer\/michael-sayman\/id358589425\">launched five apps<\/a> and had become Facebook&#8217;s youngest-ever employee. Best known for his hit game 4 Snaps, the developer caught Mark Zuckerberg&#8217;s eye, earning him a demo spot on stage at Facebook&#8217;s F8 conference. While at Facebook, Sayman built <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2016\/08\/19\/facebook-lightstage\/\">Facebook&#8217;s teen app Lifestage<\/a> &#8212; a Snapchat-like standalone project which allowed the company to explore new concepts around social networking aimed at a younger demographic.<\/p>\n<p>Lifestage was shut down two years ago, and <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2017\/11\/15\/lies-app\/\">Sayman defected to Google<\/a> shortly afterward. At Google, he was rumored to be heading up an <a href=\"https:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/news\/articles\/2018-05-02\/google-wunderkind-is-building-a-secret-social-gaming-startup\">internal social gaming effort called Arcade <\/a>where gamers played using accounts tied to their phone numbers &#8212; not a social network account.<\/p>\n<p>At the time, HQ Trivia was still a hot title, not a novelty from <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2019\/04\/14\/trivia-game-of-thrones\/\">a struggling startup<\/a> &#8212; and the new gaming effort looked liked Google&#8217;s response. However, Arcade has always been <em>only<\/em> an Area 120 project, we understand.<\/p>\n<p>To be clear, that means it&#8217;s not an official Google effort &#8212; as an Area 120 project, it&#8217;s not associated with any of Google&#8217;s broader efforts in gaming, social or anything else. Area 120 apps and services are instead built by small teams who are personally interested in pursuing an idea. In the case of Emojishot, it was Sayman&#8217;s own passion project.<\/p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-1831179\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/05\/Screen-Shot-2019-05-22-at-10.30.01-AM.png?w=680\" alt=\"\" width=\"680\" height=\"355\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/05\/Screen-Shot-2019-05-22-at-10.30.01-AM.png 2028w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/05\/Screen-Shot-2019-05-22-at-10.30.01-AM.png?resize=150,78 150w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/05\/Screen-Shot-2019-05-22-at-10.30.01-AM.png?resize=300,157 300w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/05\/Screen-Shot-2019-05-22-at-10.30.01-AM.png?resize=768,401 768w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/05\/Screen-Shot-2019-05-22-at-10.30.01-AM.png?resize=680,355 680w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/05\/Screen-Shot-2019-05-22-at-10.30.01-AM.png?resize=50,26 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Emojishot itself is meant to be played with friends, who take turns using emoji to create a picture so friends can guess the word. For example, the game&#8217;s screenshots show the word &#8220;kraken&#8221; may be drawn using an octopus, boat and arrow emojis. The emojis are selected from a keyboard below and can be resized to create the picture. This resulting picture is called the &#8220;emojishot,&#8221; and can also be saved to your Camera Roll.<\/p>\n<p>Players can pick from a variety of words that unlock and get increasingly difficult as you successfully progress through the game. The puzzles can also be shared with friends to get help with solving, and there&#8217;s a &#8220;nudge&#8221; feature to encourage a friend to return to the game and play.<\/p>\n<p><img class=\"vertical  wp-image-1831181 alignright\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/05\/Screen-Shot-2019-05-22-at-10.34.54-AM.png?w=459\" alt=\"\" width=\"270\" height=\"399\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/05\/Screen-Shot-2019-05-22-at-10.34.54-AM.png 858w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/05\/Screen-Shot-2019-05-22-at-10.34.54-AM.png?resize=101,150 101w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/05\/Screen-Shot-2019-05-22-at-10.34.54-AM.png?resize=203,300 203w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/05\/Screen-Shot-2019-05-22-at-10.34.54-AM.png?resize=768,1137 768w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/05\/Screen-Shot-2019-05-22-at-10.34.54-AM.png?resize=459,680 459w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/05\/Screen-Shot-2019-05-22-at-10.34.54-AM.png?resize=34,50 34w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 270px) 100vw, 270px\" \/>According to the game&#8217;s website, the idea was to make a fun game that explored emojis as art and a form of communication.<\/p>\n<p>Unfortunately, we were unable to test it just yet, as the service wasn&#8217;t up-and-running at the time of publication.

The pair, Suster was quick to clarify, were on site at a correctional facility in 2016 to teach inmates about entrepreneurship as part of a workshop hosted by Defy Ventures, a nonprofit organization focused on addressing the issue of mass incarceration.<\/p>\n<p>They hit it off, sharing perspectives on life and work, Suster recounted to TechCrunch. So when O&#8217;Brien, a former director of product management at <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https:\/\/crunchbase.com\/organization\/twitter\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"twitter\">Twitter, <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"><\/span><\/a> mentioned he was in the early days of building a startup, Suster listened.<\/p>\n<p>Three years later, O&#8217;Brien is ready to talk about the idea that captured the attention of the Bird, FabFitFun and Ring investor. It&#8217;s called <a href=\"https:\/\/projectorapp.com\">Projector.<\/a><\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s the brainchild of a product veteran (O&#8217;Brien) and a gaming industry engineer turned Twitter&#8217;s vice president of engineering (Projector co-founder Jeremy Gordan), a combination that has given way to an experiential and well-designed platform. Projector is browser-based, real-time collaborative design software tailored for creative teams that feels and looks like a mix of PowerPoint, Google Docs and <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https:\/\/crunchbase.com\/organization\/instagram\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"instagram\">Instagram <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"><\/span><\/a>. Though it&#8217;s still months away from a full-scale public launch, the team recently began inviting potential users to test the product for bugs.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&#8220;<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We want to reimagine visual communication in the workplace by building these easier to use tools and giving creative powers to the non-designers who have great stories to tell and who want to make a difference,&#8221; O&#8217;Brien told TechCrunch. &#8220;They want change to happen and they need to be empowered with the right kinds of tools.&#8221;<\/span><\/p>\n<p><img class=\"alignright size-large wp-image-1830261\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/05\/storymode-display.gif?w=680\" alt=\"\" width=\"680\" height=\"382\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Today, Projector is a lean team of 13 employees based in downtown San Francisco. They&#8217;ve kept quiet since late 2016 despite closing two rounds of venture capital funding. The first, a $4 million seed round, was led by Upfront&#8217;s Suster, as you may have guessed. The second, a $9 million Series A, was led by Mayfield in 2018. Hunter Walk of Homebrew, Jess Verrilli of #Angels and Nancy Duarte of Duarte, Inc. are also investors in the business, among others.<\/p>\n<p>O&#8217;Brien leads Projector as chief executive officer alongside co-founder and chief technology officer Gordon. Years ago, O&#8217;Brien was pursuing a PhD in computer graphics and information visualization at <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https:\/\/crunchbase.com\/organization\/brown-university-2\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"brown-university-2\">Brown University <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"><\/span><\/a> when he was recruited to Google&#8217;s competitive associate product manager program. He dropped out of Brown and began a career in tech that would include stints at YouTube, Twitter, Coda and, finally, his very own business.<\/p>\n<p>O&#8217;Brien and Gordan crossed paths at Twitter in 2013 and quickly realized a shared history in the gaming industry. O&#8217;Brien had spent one year as an engineer at a games startup called Mad Doc Software, while Gordon had served as the chief technology officer at Sega Studios. Gordan left Twitter in 2014 and joined Redpoint Ventures as an entrepreneur-in-residence before O&#8217;Brien pitched him on an idea that would become Projector.<\/p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_1830242\" style=\"width: 2058px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-1830242\" class=\"breakout wp-image-1830242 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/05\/jeremy-trevor-1.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2048\" height=\"1536\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/05\/jeremy-trevor-1.jpeg 2048w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/05\/jeremy-trevor-1.jpeg?resize=150,113 150w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/05\/jeremy-trevor-1.jpeg?resize=300,225 300w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/05\/jeremy-trevor-1.jpeg?resize=768,576 768w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/05\/jeremy-trevor-1.jpeg?resize=680,510 680w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/05\/jeremy-trevor-1.jpeg?resize=50,38 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 2048px) 100vw, 2048px\" \/><p id=\"caption-attachment-1830242\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Projector co-founders Jeremy Gordan (left), Twitter&#8217;s former vice president of engineering, and Trevor O&#8217;Brien, Twitter&#8217;s former director of product management<\/p><\/div><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&#8220;We knew we wanted to create a creative platform but we didn&#8217;t want to create another creative platform for purely self-expression, we wanted to do something that was a bit more purposeful,&#8221; O&#8217;Brien said. &#8220;At the end of the day, we just wanted to see good ideas succeed. And with all of those good ideas, succeeding typically starts with them being presented well to their audience.&#8221;<\/span><\/p>\n<p>Initially, Projector is targeting employees within creative organizations and marketing firms, who are frequently tasked with creating visually compelling presentations. The tool suite is free for now and will be until it&#8217;s been sufficiently tested for bugs and has fully found its footing. O&#8217;Brien says he&#8217;s not sure just yet how the team will monetize Projector, but predicts they&#8217;ll adopt Slack&#8217;s per user monthly subscription pricing model.<\/p>\n<p>As original and user-friendly as it may be, Projector is up against great competition right out of the gate. In the startup landscape, it&#8217;s got <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https:\/\/crunchbase.com\/organization\/canva\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"canva\">Canva, <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"><\/span><\/a> a graphic design platform<a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2019\/05\/20\/graphic-design-platform-canva-valued-at-2-5b-with-new-funds\/\"> valued at $2.5 billion<\/a> earlier this week with a $70 million financing. On the old-guard, it&#8217;s got Adobe, which sells a widely used suite of visual communication and graphic design tools. Not to mention Prezi, Figma and, of course, Microsoft&#8217;s PowerPoint, which is total crap but still used by millions of people.<\/p>\n<p><img class=\"alignright size-large wp-image-1830263\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/05\/formats-laptop-1.gif?w=680\" alt=\"\" width=\"680\" height=\"383\" \/><\/p>\n<p>&#8220;<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There are many tools scratching at the surface, but there&#8217;s not one visual communications tool that wins them all,&#8221; Suster said of his investment in Projector.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>Projector is still in its very early days. The company currently has just two integrations: Unsplash for free stock images and Giphy for GIFs. O&#8217;Brien would eventually like to incorporate iconography, typography and sound to liven up Projector&#8217;s visual presentation capabilities.<\/p>\n<p>The ultimate goal, aside from generally improving workplace storytelling, is to make crafting presentations fun, because shouldn&#8217;t a corporate slideshow or even a startup&#8217;s pitch be as entertaining as scrolling through your Instagram feed?<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&#8220;We wanted to try to create something that doesn&#8217;t feel like work,&#8221; O&#8217;Brien said.<\/span><\/p>\n<div class=\"embed

feature phone platform that has the distinction of being the world&#8217;s third biggest mobile OS is announcing a hefty round of funding to continue its expansion. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.kaiostech.com\">KaiOS<\/a>, which makes the OS that powers devices like Nokia&#8217;s feature phones and Jio&#8217;s devices out of India, has raised $50 million from\u00a0Cathay Innovation (which led the round) and previous investors Google and TCL Holdings.<\/p>\n<p>The funding takes the total raised by KaiOS &#8212; which has now shipped 100 million devices across 100 countries &#8212; to $72 million. It comes less than a year after <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2018\/06\/27\/google-kaios\/\">Google invested $22 million in the the business<\/a> &#8212; a strategic round that also marked KaiOS beginning the process of creating native integrations of different <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https:\/\/crunchbase.com\/organization\/google\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"google\">Google <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"><\/span><\/a> services like Maps and (<a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2019\/02\/25\/google-assistant-gets-expanded-language-support\/\">more recently<\/a>) Assistant into the platform.<\/p>\n<p>KaiOS is not disclosing its valuation but Sebastien Codeville, its CEO, confirmed to be that it is &#8220;definitely up.&#8221; (Pitchbook put it at a <a href=\"https:\/\/my.pitchbook.com\/profile\/226640-35\/company\/profile#comparisons\">very modest $43.75 million<\/a> last year on the back of Google&#8217;s earlier round.)<\/p>\n<p>We actually knew a little about this round <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2019\/02\/25\/kaios-now-with-85m-feature-phones-shipped-doubles-down-with-google-carrier-deals-and-more\/\">back in February<\/a>, at MWC in Barcelona, when KaiOS announced new handset partners and a raft of new features. A spokesperson for KaiOS told TechCrunch that the delay in closing the deal and making it public was due to a need to coordinate with different stakeholders.<\/p>\n<p>As it turned out, KaiOS&#8217;s timing for this announcement turned out to be pretty interesting. The big news this week in mobile is what kind of an impact Huawei will face in the wake of a US regulation barring it from \u00a0doing business in the US. One development in that story has been <a href=\"https:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/news\/articles\/2019-05-21\/huawei-considers-rivals-to-google-s-android-after-u-s-ban\">just how serious Huawei is about building its own operating system<\/a> to replace Google&#8217;s Android and its related services.<\/p>\n<p>This is big news because while Huawei is currently the world&#8217;s second-biggest mobile phone maker, we haven&#8217;t seen any platform gain reasonable mobile phone traction against the hegemony of iOS and Android outside of China &#8212; including the failure of Firefox OS, which retreated from the market <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2018\/02\/26\/kaios-a-feature-phone-platform-built-on-the-ashes-of-firefox-os-adds-facebook-twitter-and-google-apps\/\">only to reemerge, phoenix-like<\/a>, as KaiOS two years ago &#8212; in part because of the extensive ecosystems that have coalesced around these two.<\/p>\n<p>But while all eyes are on smartphones, KaiOS&#8217;s funding and general growth represents an interesting alternative for markets, carriers and consumers that might be in the market for what KaiOS refers to as &#8220;smart feature phones.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Today, the company counts companies like\u00a0Reliance Jio, Google, Facebook, Twitter, Orange, MTN and Qualcomm among its partners, and it&#8217;s been building an interesting, two-pronged strategy for targeting people both in developed and developing markets.<\/p>\n<p>As Sebastien Codeville, the CEO of KaiOS, describes it, in emerging markets (which are KaiOS&#8217;s primary target), its devices are being purchased by first-time phone users, or those that have had very basic, non-data mobile phones and are upgrading without the big step and expense of smartphones. &#8220;We are bringing people to internet usage with a device they are familiar with,&#8221; he said of the form factor. &#8220;Other key characteristics are a long battery life, a keyboard, and a more resistant touch panel.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>The developed market, he added, was an interesting opportunity because of the amount of professionals and others who want pared-down devices for weekend use to unplug from their daily grind.<\/p>\n<p>Many had left feature phones for dead with the growth in popularity of devices like the iPhone, app stores and of course apps themselves.

it&#8217;s launching a new tool designed to make advertisers comfortable with moving their spending over from traditional TV.<\/p>\n<p>Alison Levin, Roku&#8217;s vice president of ad sales and strategy, pointed to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.msn.com\/en-us\/money\/technologyinvesting\/3-companies-battling-for-this-massive-advertising-opportunity\/ar-BBVVxsl\">data from Magna Global<\/a> estimating that while over-the-top viewing accounts for 29 percent of all TV watch time, it only represents 3 percent of TV ad budgets. She argued that this is a wasted opportunity for advertisers because they&#8217;re struggling to reach cord-cutters and &#8220;light TV viewers.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Why is ad spend lagging? The problem, Levin said, is &#8220;a lack of tools to understand that shift.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Streaming is mainstream \u2014 brands need to shift to OTT to become whole again and find the consumers they\u2019ve lost on linear,&#8221; she said. &#8220;Roku as a platform is really uniquely positioned to solve this problem.

has a plan to make online ads more private"},"content":{"rendered":"<p id=\"speakable-summary\">For years, the web has been largely free thanks to online ads. The problem is that nobody likes them. When they&#8217;re not obnoxiously taking over your entire screen or autoplaying, they&#8217;re tracking you everywhere you go online.<\/p>\n<p>Ads can track where you go and which sites you visit and can be used to build up profiles on individuals \u2014 even if you never click on one. And when you do, they know what you bought and then they share that with other sites so they know you were up late buying ice cream, cat food, or something a little more private.<\/p>\n<p>The obvious logic would be to use an ad-blocker. But that&#8217;s not what keeps the internet thriving and available. <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https:\/\/crunchbase.com\/organization\/apple\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"apple\">Apple <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"><\/span><\/a> says it&#8217;s figured out some middle ground that keeps ads alive but without their nefarious ad tracking capabilities.<\/p>\n<p>The tech giant came up with Privacy Preserving Ad Click Attribution. Yes, it&#8217;s a mouthful but the tech itself shows promise.<\/p>\n<p>A bit of background: Any time you buy something online, the store that placed the ad knows you bought something and so do the other sites where the ad was placed. When a person clicks on an ad, the store wants to know which site the ad was clicked on so they know where to keep advertising, known as ad attribution. Ads often use tracking images \u2014 tiny, near-invisible pixel-sized trackers embedded on websites that know when you&#8217;ve opened a webpage. These pixels carry cookies, which make it easy for ads to track users across pages and entire websites. Using these invisible trackers, websites can build up profiles on people \u2014 whether they click ads or not \u2014 from site to site, such as their interests, what they want to buy, and more.<\/p>\n<p>Apple&#8217;s thinking, outlined <a href=\"https:\/\/webkit.org\/blog\/8943\/privacy-preserving-ad-click-attribution-for-the-web\/\">in a blog post<\/a> Wednesday, is that ads don&#8217;t need to share that you bought something from an online store with anyone else. Ads just need to know that someone \u2014 and not an identifiable person \u2014 clicked on an ad on a site and bought something on another.<\/p>\n<p>By taking the identifiable person out of the equation, Apple says its new technology can help preserve user privacy without reducing the effectiveness on ad campaigns.<\/p>\n<p>Apple&#8217;s new web technology, soon to be built into its Safari browser, is broken down into four parts.<\/p>\n<p>Firstly, nobody should be identifiable based off their ad clicks. Ads often use long and unique tracking codes to identify a user visiting various sites and buying things. By limiting the number of campaign IDs to just a few dozen, an advertiser won&#8217;t be able to assign unique tracking codes to each ad click, making it far more difficult to track individual users across the web. Secondly, only the website where the ad was clicked will be allowed to measure ad clicks, cutting out third-parties. Thirdly, the browser should delay the sending of ad click and conversion data \u2014 such as when someone signs up for a site or buys something \u2014 at random by up to two days to further hide the user&#8217;s activity. That data is sent through a dedicated private browsing window to ensure it&#8217;s not associated with any other browsing data.<\/p>\n<p>Lastly, Apple said it can do this at the browser level, limiting how much data the ad networks and merchants can see.<\/p>\n<p>Instead of knowing exactly who bought what and when, the privacy ad click technology will instead report back ad click and conversion data without identifying the person.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;As more and more browsers acknowledge the problems of cross-site tracking, we should expect privacy-invasive ad click attribution to become a thing of the past,&#8221; wrote Apple engineer John Wilander in a blog post.<\/p>\n<p>One of the core features of the technology is the limiting the amount of data that ads can collect.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Today&#8217;s practice of ad click attribution has no practical limit on the bits of data, which allows for full cross-site tracking of users using cookies,&#8221; explained Wilander. &#8220;But by keeping the entropy of attribution data low enough, we believe the reporting can be done in a privacy preserving way.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Simply put, by restricting the number of campaign and conversion IDs to just 64, advertisers are prevented from using long and unique values that can be used as a unique identifier to track a user from site to site. Apple says that restricted number will still give advertisers enough information to know how well their ads are performing. Advertisers, for example, can still see that a particular ad campaign leads to more completed purchases, based off a specific conversion ID, than other ad campaigns when they&#8217;re run on specific site in the last 48 hours.<\/p>\n<p>But Apple concedes that real-time tracking of purchases may be a thing of the past if the technology becomes widely adopted. By delaying the ad click and conversion reports by up to two days, advertisers lose real-time insight into who buys what and when. Apple says there&#8217;s no way to protect a user&#8217;s privacy if attribution reports are sent as soon as someone buys something.<\/p>\n<p>Apple is set to switch on the privacy feature by default in Safari later this year but knows it can&#8217;t go in alone. The company has proposed the technology as a standard to the World Wide Web Consortium in the hope other browser makers will pick up the torch and run with it.<\/p>\n<p>Anyone with a short memory will know that web standards don&#8217;t always take off. The ill-fated <a href=\"https:\/\/blog.mozilla.org\/netpolicy\/2012\/02\/23\/mozilla-led-effort-for-dnt-finds-broad-support\/\">Do Not Track web standard<\/a> was meant to allow browser users to send a signal to websites and ad networks not to be tracked. The major browser makers adopted the feature, but mired in controversy, the standard <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2015\/04\/03\/microsoft-disables-do-not-track-as-the-default-setting-in-internet-explorer\/\">never took off<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Apple thinks its proposed standard can succeed \u2014 chiefly because unlike Do Not Track the privacy ad click technology can be enforced in the browser with other privacy-minded technology. In Safari&#8217;s case, that&#8217;s <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2018\/09\/11\/the-best-security-and-privacy-features-in-ios-12-and-macos-mojave\/\">intelligence tracking prevention<\/a>. Other browsers, like <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2019\/05\/07\/chrome-privacy-security-changes\/\">Google Chrome<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2019\/04\/09\/mozilla-adds-fingerprinting-and-cryptocurrency-mining-protection-to-firefox\/\">Mozilla Firefox<\/a> are also doubling down on privacy features in an effort to win over the privacy crowd.

of social media &#8212; both as a place to vent frustration or praise (mostly frustration), and &#8212; especially over messaging apps &#8212; as a place for businesses to connect with their users.<\/p>\n<p>Now, customer support specialist <a href=\"http:\/\/zendesk.com\">Zendesk<\/a> has made an acquisition so that it can make a bigger move into how it works within social media platforms, and specifically messaging apps: it has acquired <a href=\"http:\/\/smooch.io\">Smooch<\/a>, a startup that describes itself as an &#8220;omnichannel messaging platform,&#8221; which companies&#8217; customer care teams can use to interact with people over messaging platforms like WhatsApp, WeChat, Line and Messenger, as well as SMS and email.<\/p>\n<p><a

partners<\/a>\u00a0for the WhatsApp Business API, alongside\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.voicesage.com\/\">VoiceSage<\/a>,\u00a0<a

<a href=\"https:\/\/www.twilio.com\/whatsapp\/request-access\">Twilio<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.messagebird.com\/en\/whatsapp\">MessageBird<\/a> and others are already advertising their services in this area.<\/p>\n<p>It had also been a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.zendesk.com\/apps\/support\/smoochio\/\">longtime partner of Zendesk&#8217;s<\/a>, powering the company&#8217;s own WhatsApp Business <a href=\"https:\/\/www.zendesk.com\/company\/press\/zendesk-launches-integration-whatsapp-business-solution\/\">integration<\/a>\u00a0and other features. The two already have some customers in common, including Uber. Other Smooch customers include Four Seasons, SXSW, Betterment, Clarabridge, Harry\u2019s, LVMH, Delivery Hero and BarkBox.<\/p>\n<p>Terms of the deal are not being disclosed, but <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https:\/\/crunchbase.com\/organization\/zendesk\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"zendesk\">Zendesk\u00a0SVP\u00a0<span <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"><\/span><\/a> class=\"il\">Shawna<\/span> Wolverton said in an interview that that the startup&#8217;s entire team of 48, led by co-founder and CEO\u00a0<span style=\"font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;\">Warren Levitan,<\/span>\u00a0are being offered positions with Zendesk. Smooch is based out of Montreal, Canada &#8212; so this represents an expansion for Zendesk into building an office in Canada.<\/p>\n<p>Its backers included iNovia, TA Associates and Real Ventures, who collectively had backed it with less than $10 million (when you leave in inflated hills surrounding Silicon Valley, numbers magically decline). As Zendesk is publicly traded, we may get more of a picture of the price in future quarterly reports. This is the company&#8217;s fifth acquisition to date.<\/p>\n<p>The deal underscores the big impact that messaging apps are making in customer service. While phone and internet are massive points of contact, messaging apps is one of the most-requested features Zendesk&#8217;s customers are asking for, &#8220;because they want to be where their customers are,&#8221; with WhatsApp &#8212; now at 1.5 billion users &#8212; currently at the top of the pile, Wolverton said. (More than half of Zendesk&#8217;s revenues are from outside the US, which speaks to why WhatsApp &#8212; which is bigger outside the US than it is in it &#8212; is a popular request.)<\/p>\n<p>That&#8217;s partly a by-product of how popular messaging apps are full-stop, with more than 75 percent of all smartphone users having at least one messaging app in use on their devices.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;We live in a messaging-centric world, and customers expect the convenience and interactivity of messaging to be part of their experiences,&#8221; said Mikkel Svane, Zendesk founder, CEO and chairman, in a statement. &#8220;As long-time partners with Smooch, we know first hand how much they have advanced the conversational experience to bring together all forms of messaging and create a continuous conversation between customers and businesses.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>While the two companies were already working together, the acquisition will mean a closer integration.<\/p>\n<p>That will be in multiple areas. Last year, Zendesk launched a new CRM play called Sunshine, going head to head with the likes of Salesforce in helping businesses better organise and make use of customer data. Smooch will build on that strategy to bring in data to Sunshine from messaging apps and the interactions that take place on them. Also last year, Zendesk launched an omnichannel play, a platform called The Suite, which it says <span style=\"color: #000000;\">&#8220;has become one of our most successful products ever,&#8221; with a 400 percent rise in its customers taking an omnichannel approach. Smooch already forms a key part of that, and it will be even more tightly so.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>On the outbound side, for now, there will be two areas where Smooch will be used, Wolverton said. First will be on the basic level of giving Zendesk users the ability to see and create messaging app discussions within a dashboard where they are able to monitor and handle all customer relationship contacts: a conversation that was inititated now on, say, Twitter, can be easily moved into WhatsApp or whatever more direct channel someone wants to use.<\/p>\n<p>Second, Wolverton said that customer care workers can use Smooch to send on &#8220;micro apps&#8221; to users to handle routine service enquiries, for example sending them links to make or change seat assignments on a flight.<\/p>\n<p>Over time, the plan will be to bring in more automated options into the experience, which opens the door for using more AI and potentially bots down the line.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>One of the bigger developments in customer services has been the impact of social media &#8212; both as a place to vent frustration or praise (mostly frustration), and &#8212; especially over messaging apps &#8212; as a place for businesses to connect with their users.

RBS announced that B\u00f3 had invested \u00a32 million in Loot in January this year, following an initial investment of \u00a33 million in July 2018.<\/p>\n<p>It was also presumed by many fintech insiders that Loot had been white labelled and was powering the B\u00f3 product. Clearly that was never the case, and it now raises questions around why RBS\/Natwest would invest in a competitor, only to sees its demise six months later.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2017\/12\/15\/loot\/\">Loot&#8217;s other investors included<\/a> Portag3 Ventures (Power Corporation\u2019s corporate VC arm), Austrian VC firm Speedinvest, Rocket Internet\u2019s GFC, and a number of unnamed angel investors and smaller funds.<\/p>\n<p>Founded in 2014 by now 25 year old Ollie Purdue as he was finishing up university, Loot offers a digital-only current account aimed at students and millennials, and has around 250,000 registered accounts. It comes with a Mastercard and mobile app, with a particular focus on spending insights and real-time budgeting. Like a number of competitors in the &#8220;neobank&#8221; soace, Loot doesn\u2019t have a full banking license and instead operates under an electronic money licence through a partnership with FCA regulated Wirecard.<\/p>\n<p>Meanwhile, sources tell me that Loot&#8217;s 60 or so employees were informed this lunchtime. I also understand that efforts by Loot founder Ollie Purdue and others within London&#8217;s close-nit fintech community are already underway to safe land as many of those employees as possible, and that around 30 job offers are already in motion.<\/p>\n<p>Loot declined to comment.

class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"><\/span><\/a> will roll out default wi-fi device tracking on the London Underground this summer, following a trial back in 2016.<\/p>\n<p>In a press release announcing the move, TfL writes that &#8220;secure, privacy-protected data collection will begin on July 8&#8221; &#8212; while touting additional services, such as improved alerts about delays and congestion, which it frames as &#8220;customer benefits&#8221;, as expected to launch &#8220;later in the year&#8221;.<\/p>\n<p>As well as offering additional alerts-based services to passengers via its own website\/apps, TfL says it could incorporate crowding data into its free open-data API &#8212; to allow app developers, academics and businesses to expand the utility of the data by baking it into their own products and services.<\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s not all just added utility though; TfL says it will also use the information to enhance its in-station marketing analytics &#8212; and, it hopes, top up its revenues &#8212; by tracking footfall around ad units and billboards.<\/p>\n<p>Commuters using the UK capital&#8217;s publicly funded transport network who do not want their movements being tracked will have to switch off their wi-fi, or else put their phone in airplane mode when using the network.<\/p>\n<p>To deliver data of the required detail, TfL says detailed digital mapping of all London Underground stations was undertaken to identify where wi-fi routers are located so it can understand how commuters move across the network and through stations.<\/p>\n<p>It says it will erect signs at stations informing passengers that using the wi-fi will result in connection data being collected &#8220;to better understand journey patterns and improve our services&#8221; &#8212; and explaining that to opt out they have to switch off their device&#8217;s wi-fi.<\/p>\n<p>Attempts in recent years by smartphone OSes to use MAC address randomization to try to defeat persistent device tracking have been shown to be <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theregister.co.uk\/2017\/03\/10\/mac_address_randomization\/\">vulnerable to reverse engineering<\/a> via flaws in wi-fi set-up protocols. So, er, switch off to be sure.<\/p>\n<p><img class=\"vertical size-large wp-image-1831117 aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/05\/Screenshot-2019-05-22-at-13.14.36.png?w=357\" alt=\"\" width=\"357\" height=\"680\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/05\/Screenshot-2019-05-22-at-13.14.36.png 642w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/05\/Screenshot-2019-05-22-at-13.14.36.png?resize=79,150 79w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/05\/Screenshot-2019-05-22-at-13.14.36.png?resize=157,300 157w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/05\/Screenshot-2019-05-22-at-13.14.36.png?resize=357,680 357w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/05\/Screenshot-2019-05-22-at-13.14.36.png?resize=26,50 26w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 357px) 100vw, 357px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>We covered TfL&#8217;s wi-fi tracking beta <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2017\/10\/07\/how-anonymous-wifi-data-can-still-be-a-privacy-risk\/\">back in 2017<\/a>, when we reported that despite claiming the harvested wi-fi data was &#8220;de-personalised\u201d, and claiming individuals using the Tube network could not be identified, TfL nonetheless declined to release the &#8220;anonymized&#8221; data-set after a Freedom of Information request &#8212; saying there remains a risk of individuals being re-identified.<\/p>\n<p>As has been shown many times before, reversing &#8216;anonymization&#8217; of personal data can be frighteningly easy.<\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s not immediately clear from the press release or TfL&#8217;s website exactly how it will be encrypting the location data gathered from devices that authenticate to use the free wi-fi at the circa 260 wi-fi enabled London Underground stations.<\/p>\n<p>Its <a href=\"https:\/\/tfl.gov.uk\/corporate\/privacy-and-cookies\/wi-fi-data-collection?cid=wifi-data-collection#on-this-page-2\">explainer about the data collection<\/a> does not go into any real detail about the encryption and security being used. (We&#8217;ve asked for more technical details.)<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;If the device has been signed up for free Wi-Fi on the London Underground network, the device will disclose its genuine MAC address. This is known as an authenticated device,&#8221; TfL writes generally of how the tracking will work. (Ergo, this is another instance where &#8216;free&#8217; wi-fi isn&#8217;t actually free &#8212; as one <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/EerkeBoiten\">security expert<\/a> we spoke to pointed out.)<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;We process authenticated device MAC address connections (along with the date and time the device authenticated with the Wi-Fi network and the location of each router the device connected to). This helps us to better understand how customers move through and between stations &#8212; we look at how long it took for a device to travel between stations, the routes the device took and waiting times at busy periods.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;We do not collect any other data generated by your device. This includes web browsing data and data from website cookies,&#8221; TfL adds, saying also that &#8220;individual customer data will never be shared and customers will not be personally identified from the data collected by TfL&#8221;.<\/p>\n<p>In a section entitled &#8220;keeping information secure&#8221; it further writes: &#8220;Each MAC address is automatically depersonalised (pseudonymised) and encrypted to prevent the identification of the original MAC address and associated device. The data is stored in a restricted area of a secure location and it will not be linked to any other data at a device level.\u00a0 At no time does TfL store a device&#8217;s original MAC address.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Privacy and security concerns were raised about the location tracking around the time of the 2016 trial &#8212; such as why TfL had used a monthly salt key to encrypt the data rather than daily salts, which would have decreased the risk of data being re-identifiable should it leak out.<\/p>\n<p>Such concerns persist &#8212; and security experts are now calling for full technical details to be released, given TfL is going full steam ahead with a rollout.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-width=\"550\" data-dnt=\"true\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">London tube is rolling out wifi tracking of commuter smartphones, full scale.

We&#8217;ll update as and when we get more from TfL.<\/p>\n<p>Another question over the deployment at the time of the trial was what legal basis it would use for pervasively collecting people&#8217;s location data &#8212; since the system requires an active opt-out by commuters a consent-based legal basis would not be appropriate.<\/p>\n<p>In a section on the legal basis for processing the Wi-Fi connection data, TfL writes now that its &#8216;legal ground&#8217; is two-fold:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Our statutory and public functions<\/li>\n<li>to undertake activities to promote and encourage safe, integrated, efficient and economic transport facilities and services, and to deliver the Mayor&#8217;s Transport Strategy<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>So, presumably, you can file &#8216;increasing revenue around adverts in stations by being able to track nearby footfall&#8217; under &#8216;helping to deliver (read: fund) the mayor&#8217;s transport strategy&#8217;.<\/p>\n<p>(Or as TfL puts it: &#8220;[T]he data will also allow TfL to better understand customer flows throughout stations, highlighting the effectiveness and accountability of its advertising estate based on actual customer volumes. Being able to reliably demonstrate this should improve commercial revenue, which can then be reinvested back into the transport network.&#8221;)<\/p>\n<p>On data retention it specifies that it will hold &#8220;depersonalised Wi-Fi connection data&#8221; for two years &#8212; after which it will aggregate the data and retain those non-individual insights (presumably indefinitely, or per its standard data retention policies).<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;The exact parameters of the aggregation are still to be confirmed, but will result in the individual Wi-Fi connection data being removed. Instead, we will retain counts of activities grouped into specific time periods and locations,&#8221; it writes on that.<\/p>\n<p>It further notes that aggregated data &#8220;developed by combining depersonalised data from many devices&#8221; may also be shared with other TfL departments and external bodies. So that processed data could certainly travel.<\/p>\n<p>Of the &#8220;individual depersonalised device Wi-Fi connection data&#8221;, TfL claims it is accessible only to &#8220;a controlled group of TfL employees&#8221; &#8212; without specifying how large this group of staff is; and what sort of controls and processes will be in place to prevent the risk of A) data being hacked and\/or leaking out or B) data being re-identified by a staff member.<\/p>\n<p>A TfL employee with intimate knowledge of a partner&#8217;s daily travel routine might, for example, have access to enough information via the system to be able to reverse the depersonalization.<\/p>\n<p>Without more technical details we just don&#8217;t know. Though TfL says it worked with the UK&#8217;s data protection watchdog in designing the data collection with privacy front of mind.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;We take the privacy of our customers very seriously. A range of policies, processes and technical measures are in place to control and safeguard access to, and use of, Wi-Fi connection data. Anyone with access to this data must complete TfL&#8217;s privacy and data protection training every year,&#8221; it also notes elsewhere.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-width=\"550\" data-dnt=\"true\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">We need more details how tokenization is deployed.

With this, the company, which won our <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2015\/09\/23\/agrilyst-wins-techcrunch-disrupt-sf-2015\/\">2015 Disrupt SF Battlefield competition<\/a>, has now raised a total of $11.75 million.<\/p>\n<p>When <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https:\/\/crunchbase.com\/organization\/agrilyst-inc\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"agrilyst-inc\">Agrilyst <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"><\/span><\/a> launched, the company mostly focused on helping indoor farmers and greenhouse operators manage their operations by gathering data about their crop yields and other metrics. Over the course of the last few years, that mission has expanded quite a bit, though, and today&#8217;s Artemis sees itself as an enterprise Cultivation Management Platform (CMP) that focuses on all aspects of indoor farming, including managing workers and ensuring compliance with food safety and local cannabis regulations, for example.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/05\/Artemis-Timeline-Laptop.png\"><img class=\"breakout aligncenter size-full wp-image-1831071\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/05\/Artemis-Timeline-Laptop.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"768\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/05\/Artemis-Timeline-Laptop.png 2048w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/05\/Artemis-Timeline-Laptop.png?resize=150,113 150w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/05\/Artemis-Timeline-Laptop.png?resize=300,225 300w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/05\/Artemis-Timeline-Laptop.png?resize=768,576 768w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/05\/Artemis-Timeline-Laptop.png?resize=680,510 680w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/05\/Artemis-Timeline-Laptop.png?resize=50,38 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>The expanded platform is meant to give these businesses a single view of all of their operations and integrates with existing systems that range from climate control to ERP tools and Point of Sale systems.<\/p>\n<p>Compliance is a major part of the expanded platform.<\/p>\n<div>\u201cWhen you look at enterprise operations, that risk is compounded because it\u2019s not just that risk across many, many sites and many acres, so in 2018, we switched to almost entirely focusing on those operations and have gained a lot of momentum in that space,\u201d Kopf said. &#8220;And now we&#8217;re using the funding to expand from mainly focusing on managing that data to help with profitability to using that data to help you with everything from compliance down to the profitability element. We want to limit that exposure to controllable risk.&#8221;<\/div>\n<p>With this new focus on compliance, the company also added Dr. Kathleen Merrigan to its board.

Artemis\u2019 approach to using data as a catalyst for growth and risk management provides the company a significant advantage with enterprise-level horticulture operations,\u201d said Merrigan.<\/p>\n<p>Cannabis, it&#8217;s worth noting, was not something the company really focused on in its early years, but as the company&#8217;s CEO and founder <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https:\/\/crunchbase.com\/person\/allison-kopf\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"person\" data-entity=\"allison-kopf\">Allison Kopf <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"><\/span><\/a> told me, it now accounts for about half of the company&#8217;s revenue. Only a few years ago, many investors were also uncomfortable investing in a company that was in the cannabis business, but that&#8217;s far less of an issue today.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;When we raised our seed round in 2015, we were pitching to a lot of funds and a lot of funds told us that they had LPs that can&#8217;t invest in cannabis. So if you&#8217;re pitching that you&#8217;re going to eventually be in cannabis, we&#8217;re going to have to step away from the investment, &#8221; Kopf said. &#8220;Now, folks are saying: &#8216;If you&#8217;re not in cannabis, we don&#8217;t want to invest.'&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Today, Artemis&#8217;s clients are worth a collective $5 billion.

vote which kicks off tomorrow.<\/p>\n<p>Following the independent investigation, Facebook has taken down a total of 77 pages and 230 accounts from Germany, UK, France, Italy, Spain and Poland &#8212; which had been followed by an estimated 32 million people and generated 67 million &#8216;interactions&#8217; (i.e. comments, likes, shares) in the last three months alone.<\/p>\n<p>The bogus mainly far-right disinformation networks were not identified by Facebook &#8212; but had been reported to it by campaign group <a href=\"https:\/\/secure.avaaz.org\/page\/en\/\">Avaaz<\/a> &#8212; which says the fake pages had more Facebook followers and interactions than all the main EU far right and anti-EU parties combined.<\/p>\n<div class=\"page\" title=\"Page 6\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p>&#8220;The results are overwhelming: the disinformation networks upon which Facebook acted had more interactions (13 million) in the past three months than the main party pages of the League, AfD, <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https:\/\/crunchbase.com\/organization\/coppertino\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"coppertino\">VOX, <span

reveals an <\/span><span style=\"font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;\">even clearer image. The Facebook networks takedown had almost three times (5.9 million) the number of followers as AfD, VOX, Brexit Party, Rassemblement National and PiS\u2019s main Facebook pages combined (2 million).&#8221;<\/span><\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<p>Avaaz has previously found and announced far right disinformation networks operating in Spain, Italy and Poland &#8212; and a spokesman confirmed to us it&#8217;s re-reporting some of its findings now (such as the ~30 pages and groups in Spain that had racked up 1.7M followers and 7.4M interactions, which we covered <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2019\/04\/23\/facebook-has-quietly-removed-three-bogus-far-right-networks-in-spain-ahead-of-sundays-elections\/\">last month<\/a>) to highlight an overall total for the investigation.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Our <a href=\"https:\/\/avaazimages.avaaz.org\/Avaaz%20Report%20Network%20Deception%2020190522.pdf\">report<\/a> contains new information for France, United Kingdom and Germany,&#8221; the spokesman added.<\/p>\n<p>Examples of politically charged disinformation being spread via Facebook by the bogus networks it found include a fake viral video seen by 10 million people that supposedly shows migrants in Italy destroying a police car (but was actually from a movie; which Avaaz adds that this fake had been &#8220;debunked years ago&#8221;); a story in Poland claiming that migrant taxi drivers rape European women, including a fake image; and fake news about a child cancer center being closed down by Catalan separatists in Spain.<\/p>\n<p>There&#8217;s lots more country-specific detail in its <a href=\"https:\/\/avaazimages.avaaz.org\/Avaaz%20Report%20Network%20Deception%2020190522.pdf\">full report<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>In all, Avaaz reported more than 500 suspicious pages and groups to Facebook related to the three-month investigation of Facebook disinformation networks in Europe. Though Facebook only took down a subset of the far right muck-spreaders &#8212; around 15% of the suspicious pages reported to it.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;The networks were either spreading disinformation or using tactics to amplify their mainly anti-immigration, anti-EU, or racist content, in a way that appears to breach Facebook\u2019s own policies,&#8221; Avaaz writes of what it found.<\/p>\n<p>It estimates that content posted by all the suspicious pages it reported had been viewed some 533 million times over the pre-election period. Albeit, there&#8217;s no way to know whether or not everything it judged suspicious actually was.<\/p>\n<p>In a statement responding to Avaaz&#8217;s findings, Facebook told us:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>We thank Avaaz for sharing their research for us to investigate. As we have said, we are focused on protecting the integrity of elections across the European Union and around the world. We have removed a number of fake and duplicate accounts that were violating our authenticity policies, as well as multiple Pages for name change and other violations. We also took action against some additional Pages that repeatedly posted misinformation. We will take further action if we find additional violations.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>The company did not respond to our question asking why it failed to unearth this political disinformation itself.<\/p>\n<p>Ahead of the EU parliament vote, which begins tomorrow, Facebook invited a select group of journalists to tour a new <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2019\/05\/03\/when-it-comes-to-elections-facebook-moves-slow-may-still-break-things\/\">Dublin-based election security &#8216;war room&#8217;<\/a> &#8212; where it talked about a \u201cfive pillars of countering disinformation\u201d strategy to prevent cynical attempts to manipulate voters&#8217; views.<\/p>\n<p>But as Avaaz&#8217;s investigation shows there&#8217;s plenty of political disinformation flying by entirely unchecked.<\/p>\n<p>One major ongoing issue where political disinformation and Facebook&#8217;s platform is concerned is that <em>how<\/em> the company enforces its own rules remains entirely opaque.<\/p>\n<p>We don&#8217;t get to see all the detail &#8212; so can&#8217;t judge and assess all its decisions. Yet Facebook has been known to shut down swathes of accounts deemed fake ahead of elections, while apparently failing entirely to find other fakes (such as in this case).<\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s a situation that does not look compatible with the continued functioning of democracy given Facebook&#8217;s massive reach and power to influence.<\/p>\n<p>Nor is the company under an obligation to report every fake account it confirms. Instead, Facebook gets to control the timing and flow of any official announcements it chooses to make about &#8220;coordinated inauthentic behaviour&#8221; &#8212; dropping these self-selected disclosures as and when it sees fit, and making them sound as routine as possible by cloaking them in its standard, dryly worded newspeak.<\/p>\n<p>Back in January, Facebook COO <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https:\/\/crunchbase.com\/person\/sheryl-sandberg\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"person\" data-entity=\"sheryl-sandberg\">Sheryl Sandberg <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"><\/span><\/a> <a href=\"https:\/\/venturebeat.com\/2019\/01\/21\/sheryl-sandberg-says-facebook-is-now-blocking-1-million-fake-accounts-every-day\/\">admitted<\/a> publicly that the company is blocking more than 1M fake accounts <em>every day. <\/em>If Facebook was reporting every fake it finds it would therefore need to do so via a real-time dashboard &#8212; not sporadic newsroom blog posts that inherently play down the scale of what is clearly embedded into its platform, and may be so massive and ongoing that it&#8217;s not really possible to know where Facebook stops and &#8216;Fakebook&#8217; starts.<\/p>\n<p>The suspicious behaviours that Avaaz attached to the pages and groups it found that appeared to be in breach of Facebook&#8217;s stated rules include the use of fake accounts, spamming, misleading page name changes and suspected coordinated inauthentic behavior.<\/p>\n<p>When Avaaz previously reported the Spanish far right networks Facebook subsequently told us it had removed &#8220;a number&#8221; of pages violating its &#8220;authenticity policies&#8221;, including one page for name change violations but claimed &#8220;we aren\u2019t removing accounts or Pages for coordinated inauthentic behavior&#8221;.<\/p>\n<p>So again, it&#8217;s worth emphasizing that Facebook gets to define what is and isn&#8217;t acceptable on its platform &#8212; including creating terms that seek to normalize its own inherently dysfunctional &#8216;rules&#8217; and their &#8216;enforcement&#8217;.<\/p>\n<p>Such as by creating terms like &#8220;coordinated inauthentic behavior&#8221;, which sets a threshold of Facebook&#8217;s own choosing for what it will and won&#8217;t judge political disinformation. It&#8217;s inherently self-serving.<\/p>\n<p>Given that Facebook only acted on a small proportion of what Avaaz found and reported overall, we might posit that the company is setting a very high bar for acting against suspicious activity. And that plenty of election fiddling is free flowing under its feeble radar. (When we previously asked <span class=\"il\">Facebook<\/span> whether it was disputing Avaaz&#8217;s finding of coordinated inauthentic behaviour vis-a-vis the far right disinformation networks it reported in Spain the company did not respond to the question.)<\/p>\n<p>Much of the publicity around Facebook&#8217;s self-styled &#8220;election security&#8221; efforts has also focused on how it&#8217;s enforcing new disclosure rules around political ads. But again political disinformation masquerading as organic content continues being spread across its platform &#8212; where it&#8217;s being shown to be racking up millions of interactions with people&#8217;s brains and eyeballs.<\/p>\n<p>Plus, as we reported <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2019\/05\/21\/facebook-still-a-great-place-to-amplify-pre-election-junk-news-eu-study-finds\/\">yesterday<\/a>, research conducted by the Oxford Internet Institute into pre-EU election content sharing on Facebook has found that sources of disinformation-spreading &#8216;junk news&#8217; generate far greater engagement on its platform than professional journalism.<\/p>\n<p>So while Facebook&#8217;s platform is also clearly full of real people sharing actual news and views, the fake BS which Avaaz&#8217;s findings imply is also flooding the platform, gets spread around more, on a per unit basis. And it&#8217;s democracy that suffers &#8212; because vote manipulators are able to pass off manipulative propaganda and hate speech\u00a0as <em>bona fide<\/em> news and views as a consequence of Facebook publishing the fake stuff alongside genuine opinions and professional journalism.<\/p>\n<p>It does not have algorithms that can perfectly distinguish one from the other, and has suggested it never will.<\/p>\n<p>The bottom line is that even if Facebook dedicates far more resource (human and AI) to rooting out &#8216;election interference&#8217; the wider problem is that a commercial entity which benefits from engagement on an ad-funded platform is also the referee setting the rules.<\/p>\n<p>Indeed, the whole loud Facebook publicity effort around &#8220;election security&#8221; looks like a cynical attempt to distract the rest of us from how broken its rules are. Or, in other words, a platform that accelerates propaganda is also seeking to manipulate and skew our views.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>A multi-month hunt for political disinformation spreading on Facebook in Europe suggests there are concerted efforts to use the platform to spread bogus far right propaganda to millions of voters ahead of a key EU vote which kicks off tomorrow.

self-reliance in a bid to stay competitive.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;China has come to the forefront of development. There is less and less room for taking the best from outside and improving on them. As the <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https:\/\/crunchbase.com\/organization\/zte-corporation\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"zte-corporation\">ZTE <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"><\/span><\/a> and Huawei cases have intensified recently, we are also constantly watching whether the trade war will turn into a tech war,&#8221; said Ma at an event in China&#8217;s Yunnan Province per a transcript Tencent provided to TechCrunch.<\/p>\n<p>Ma&#8217;s concern is not unexpected. As recent US-China negotiations show, the Shenzhen-based telecommunication and smartphone giant has become deeply entangled in the trade spat. The Commerce Department last week restricted American companies from selling components and other technology to Huawei &#8212; which the Trump administration has labeled as posing a national security threat &#8212; though it has since <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2019\/05\/20\/u-s-mitigates-huawei-ban-by-offering-temporary-reprieve\/\">scaled back the ban<\/a>. That would eventually cut Huawei off from <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2019\/05\/19\/google-reportedly-suspends-select-business-with-huawei-following-u-s-ban\/\">certain services from Google<\/a>, chips made by <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2019\/05\/20\/several-chip-companies-including-qualcomm-and-intel-have-reportedly-stopped-supplying-huawei-after-blacklist\/\">Qualcomm and Intel,<\/a> and its other American suppliers.<\/p>\n<p>Despite China&#8217;s efforts to lead in global innovation, many of its tech startups and champions still rely heavily on imported technologies to deliver products and services. People have celebrated this level of interdependence as a result of trade, but increasingly they worry decoupling the US and China will hurt companies on both sides and lead to a <a href=\"https:\/\/stratechery.com\/2019\/china-leverage-and-values\/\">bifurcation<\/a> of the global tech economy.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"N9f8DxpsER\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2019\/05\/20\/why-startups-need-to-be-careful-about-export-licenses-and-the-huawei-ban\/\">Why startups need to be careful about export licenses and the Huawei ban<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe title=\"&#8220;Why startups need to be careful about export licenses and the Huawei ban&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2019\/05\/20\/why-startups-need-to-be-careful-about-export-licenses-and-the-huawei-ban\/embed\/#?secret=N9f8DxpsER\" data-secret=\"N9f8DxpsER\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<p>&#8220;[China]&#8217;s digital economy will be a high-rise built on sand and hard to sustain if we don&#8217;t continue to work hard on basic research and key knowledge, not to mention the transformation from old to new forms of drivers or high-quality development,&#8221; Ma pointed out.<\/p>\n<p><a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https:\/\/crunchbase.com\/person\/jack-ma\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"person\" data-entity=\"jack-ma\">Jack Ma, <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"><\/span><\/a> founder of Tencent&#8217;s arch-foe Alibaba, remarked along the same line\u00a0following <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2018\/04\/16\/u-s-companies-banned-from-selling-components-to-zte\/\">a similar ban<\/a> placed on the sale of American components to Huawei rival ZTE in April of last year.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;It is the compelling obligation for big companies to compete in core technology,&#8221; said Alibaba&#8217;s Ma at an industry event per a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.scmp.com\/tech\/china-tech\/article\/2142869\/chinese-internet-leaders-call-core-technology-ownership-after-us-ban\">report<\/a> from the South China Morning Post.<\/p>\n<p>The latest technology ban from the US has now accelerated Huawei&#8217;s efforts to become more technologically independent.

Ford\u2019s future, two-legged robots and self-driving cars could team up on deliveries"},"content":{"rendered":"<p id=\"speakable-summary\"><span class=\"featured__span-first-words\">Autonomous vehicles might<\/span> someday be able to navigate bustling city streets to deliver groceries, pizzas, and other packages without a human behind the wheel. But that doesn&#8217;t solve what Ford Motor CTO Ken Washington describes as the last 50-foot problem.<\/p>\n<p>Ford and startup <a href=\"http:\/\/www.agilityrobotics.com\/\">Agility Robotics<\/a> are partnering in a research project that will test how two-legged robots and self-driving vehicles can work together to solve that curb-to-door problem. Agility&#8217;s Digit, a two-legged robot that has a lidar where its head should be, will be used in the project. The robot, which is capable of lifting 40 pounds, can ride along in a self-driving vehicle and be deployed when needed to delivery packages.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re looking at the opportunity of autonomous vehicles through the lens of the consumer and we know from some early experimentation that there are challenges with the last 50 feet,&#8221; Washington told TechCrunch in a recent interview. Finding a solution could be an important differentiator for Ford&#8217;s commercial robotaxi service, which it plans to launch in 2021.<\/p>\n<p>The communication between Digit and a Ford autonomous vehicle is perhaps the most compelling piece of this research project. As the GIF below shows, the AV arrives at its destination, the hatch of the Ford Transit van opens and Digit unfolds itself, then grabs the package and walks to the door.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/05\/Agility-GIF-1.gif\"><img class=\"wp-image-1831007 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/05\/Agility-GIF-1.gif\" alt=\"Ford Agility Robotics\" width=\"700\" height=\"394\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>Digit is equipped with lidar and stereo cameras, just enough sensors for basic navigation.<\/p>\n<p>But there&#8217;s more to the story. The autonomous vehicle \u2014 equipped with a robust suite of sensors and computing power that allows for more complex decision making \u2014 is sharing its data with Digit long before it is deployed. When Digit &#8220;wakes up&#8221; it already knows where it is in the world. And if Digit runs into trouble, it can communicate with the idling AV for that extra perception and decision-making prowess.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/05\/Agility-GIF-2.gif\"><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-1831006 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/05\/Agility-GIF-2.gif\" alt=\"\" width=\"700\" height=\"394\" \/><\/a>This solves what Agility CEO Damion Shelton describes as a &#8220;classic robotics problem,&#8221; of helping the robot know where it is when it wakes up from its sleep state.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;If you know you&#8217;re riding around in the vehicle with a clear view of your entire surroundings, it&#8217;s a lot easier to get up and move around,&#8221; Shelton explained. &#8220;That&#8217;s really how we&#8217;re viewing the primary purpose of this beta exchange; to help the robot be aware of its surroundings, so that you don&#8217;t go through this sort of boot up process where the robot gets out of the car and is confused for the first 30 seconds it&#8217;s turned on.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Agility&#8217;s Digit robot isn&#8217;t the only option Ford is experimenting with to solve that vehicle-to-doorstep problem, Washington said. However, Washington did note that the two-legged robots do have certain advantages, like the ability to step over cracks in the sidewalk and walk up stairs, that can be problematic for wheeled robots.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/05\/ford-agility-0290_C1.jpg\"><img class=\"breakout wp-image-1831046 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/05\/ford-agility-0290_C1.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"5000\" height=\"3333\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/05\/ford-agility-0290_C1.jpg 5000w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/05\/ford-agility-0290_C1.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/05\/ford-agility-0290_C1.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/05\/ford-agility-0290_C1.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/05\/ford-agility-0290_C1.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/05\/ford-agility-0290_C1.jpg?resize=50,33 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 5000px) 100vw, 5000px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>Ford and Agility&#8217;s agreement is categorized as a research project, for now. <span style=\"font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;\">Ford has not taken an equity stake in Agility, Washington said, although he quickly added &#8220;that doesn&#8217;t mean we&#8217;re not open to it at some point.&#8221;\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p>For Agility, this project is a turning point \u2014 or certainly an acceleration \u2014 of its very new business. The robotics startup spun out of Oregon State University in late 2015 with an aim to commercialize research from the Dynamic Robotics Laboratory on bipedal locomotion. The company introduced its ostrich-inspired Cassie robot in 2017 as a bipedal research platform. Digit, which added an upper torso, arms, sensors, and additional computing power to the Cassie design, was introduced in February 2019.<\/p>\n<p>Agility has 20 employees, about half of whom support the construction of the robots. The company has raised nearly $8.8 million in capital from a seed and Series A round. And now, with this latest partnership, Agility is prepping to raise another round to help it scale.<\/p>\n<p>Agility has made two first-generation Digit robots. The company, which has offices in Albany, Oregon and Pittsburgh, plans to unveil the second-generation Digit in early summer. A third version of Digit \u2014 marking the final design of this bipedal robot \u2014 will likely come out in summer or early fall, Shelton said.<\/p>\n<p>Agility will produce about six of these final versions of Digit. From here, Shelton estimated the company will have a steady state production of about two Digits a month. Ultimately, Agility is on pace to make between 50 and 100 by 2021.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/05\/argo-ai-ford-miami.jpg\"><img class=\"breakout aligncenter wp-image-1831049 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/05\/argo-ai-ford-miami.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"5735\" height=\"3823\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/05\/argo-ai-ford-miami.jpg 5735w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/05\/argo-ai-ford-miami.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/05\/argo-ai-ford-miami.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/05\/argo-ai-ford-miami.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/05\/argo-ai-ford-miami.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/05\/argo-ai-ford-miami.jpg?resize=50,33 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 5735px) 100vw, 5735px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>All of this research and experimentation is part of the Ford&#8217;s eventual goal to launch a commercial robotaxi service.
