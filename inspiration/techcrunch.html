The arbitrary figure of $292 million was simply the result of how much liquidity existing shareholders were willing to make available, and nowhere near the upper level of interest.<\/p>\n<p>He also pointed out that existing institutional investors aren&#8217;t exiting during this round, with Andreessen Horowitz and Baillie Gifford actually doubling down somewhat. Instead, this liquidity event was mainly a way for TransferWise employees &#8212; existing and presumably former &#8212; to cash in on some or all of their stake. And for new later-stage investors to jump on-board.<\/p>\n<p>All of which &#8212; and at <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2017\/11\/01\/transferwise-280-million\/\">the risk of repeating myself<\/a> &#8212; would suggest that a potential TransferWise public offering is <em>still<\/em> a long way off yet, something that Hinrikus doesn&#8217;t refute. &#8220;Why would we go public?,&#8221; he says rhetorically, noting that the company is still growing fast and capital isn&#8217;t an issue.<\/p>\n<p>So why then in contrast are other fast-growing companies going public much earlier these days? &#8220;You&#8217;d have to ask them,&#8221; Hinrikus says, batting away my question in his usual laid back and matter-of-fact manner. Pressed a little harder, he says that one difference might be that TransferWise&#8217;s institutional investors aren&#8217;t (yet) pushing for a liquidity event on the scale of an IPO. As already noted, in some instances they are actually purchasing more shares in the company.<\/p>\n<p>Hinrikus also says the regulatory climate is now changing in TransferWise&#8217;s favour. In 2018, the EU voted to mandate the outlawing of exchange rate mark-ups on international payments through its Cross-Border Payments Regulations, something that the London fintech company has long been lobbying for. Australia is thought to be considering similar regulatory measures following an inquiry into the issue by the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission.<\/p>\n<p>To that end, TransferWise says it now serves 5 million customers worldwide, processing \u00a34 billion every month. Every year it estimates it saves customers \u00a31 billion in bank fees. The service currently supports 1,600 currency routes, and is available for 49 currencies.<\/p>\n<p>The company employs more than 1,600 people across 12 global offices and says it will hire 750 more people in the next 12 months.

Given that&#8217;s often $5 or more, users stand to save a lot if they order in frequently. But Uber could still earn money on menu item markups, cover costs with a flat order fee that protects against someone ordering a single taco, and, most importantly, build loyalty and scale at a time of intense food delivery competition.<\/p>\n<p>The Uber Eats Pass was first spotted by <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/wongmjane\/status\/1131031482913288192\">Jane Manchun Wong<\/a>, the notorious reverse-engineering specialist who&#8217;s become a frequent TechCrunch tipster. She managed to generate screenshots from Uber&#8217;s Android app code that reveals a prototype of the feature. &#8220;Get free delivery, any restaurant, any time,&#8221; it says, showing the amount of money you could save or already saved.<\/p>\n<p>An Uber spokesperson did not dispute the legitimacy of the findings and told TechCrunch, &#8220;We\u2019re always thinking about new ways to enhance the Eats experience.\u201d They declined to provide further details, which could hint that a launch is imminent but some details are still subject to change. For now we don&#8217;t know exactly which perks come with an Eats Pass or where it will be launching first.<\/p>\n<p>At $9.99 per month, the Uber Eats Pass would cost the same and work similarly to Postmates Unlimited and DoorDash DashPass. If they all seem like good deals, you see why they&#8217;re less about immediate revenue and more about customer lock-in. You&#8217;re a lot less likely to order GrubHub or Caviar if you&#8217;ve already pre-paid to cover your Uber Eats delivery costs. And whichever apps emerge from this battle will have instituted the scale and steady behavior to raise prices or just enjoy large lifetime value from each subscriber.<\/p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-1831051\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/05\/Uber-Eats-Pass-Checkout.jpg?w=680\" alt=\"\" width=\"680\" height=\"510\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/05\/Uber-Eats-Pass-Checkout.jpg 1080w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/05\/Uber-Eats-Pass-Checkout.jpg?resize=150,113 150w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/05\/Uber-Eats-Pass-Checkout.jpg?resize=300,225 300w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/05\/Uber-Eats-Pass-Checkout.jpg?resize=768,576 768w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/05\/Uber-Eats-Pass-Checkout.jpg?resize=680,510 680w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/05\/Uber-Eats-Pass-Checkout.jpg?resize=50,38 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Exploring new business opportunities could help perk up Uber&#8217;s share price, which closed at $41.50 today, two weeks after IPOing at an opening price of $42. There are fears that intense competition across both ridesharing and food delivery could make for an expensive road ahead for the newly public company. Any way it can gain an edge on its rivals&#8217; users from straying to them is important. The logistics giant is already experimenting with <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2018\/12\/04\/uber-eats-specials\/\">allowing restaurants to offer discounts in exchange for promoted placement<\/a> in the app, which is the <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2018\/12\/10\/uber-ads\/\">first step to Uber becoming an ads company<\/a>, where businesses pay for extra exposure.<\/p>\n<p>If Uber combined Eats Pass with its car service subscription Ride Passes, you have the foundation for a sort of Uber Prime experience &#8212; one where you pay an upfront subscription fee that scores you perks and discounts but also makes you likely to spend a lot more on Uber. That bundle could be even more central to Uber than Amazon, which has few direct rivals in the west. People will need to eat and get around for the foreseeable future. Subsidizing loyalty now could be costly in the short-term, but poise Uber for years of lucrative business down the line.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>What&#8217;s the cord-cutting equivalent to ditching your kitchen?

is a handy new app that keeps your iOS contact photos up to date"},"content":{"rendered":"<p id=\"speakable-summary\">If there&#8217;s a special place in your heart for single-purpose utilities that solve a nagging problem, then you&#8217;re going to want to skip your daily Starbucks coffee and instead buy yourself a copy of the new iOS contacts utility <a href=\"https:\/\/itunes.apple.com\/us\/app\/vignette-update-contact-pics\/id1455924925?mt=8\">Vignette<\/a>. The new app is focused on doing one thing well: finding photos for your contacts by scouring social media profiles and updating them.<\/p>\n<p>Many people don&#8217;t bother to add a photo when entering in an iOS contact for the first time &#8212; it&#8217;s often an afterthought at best. And because the iOS Contacts app directs you to your own photo library to find an image when editing a contact, adding a photo tends to be something people only do for close friends and family.\u00a0 (After all, most people don&#8217;t carry around photos of co-workers, clients or business colleagues on their iPhone.)<\/p>\n<p>But that means when you use Apple&#8217;s Phone app or iMessage and others, you see gray boxes with the person&#8217;s initials instead of a colorful picture.<\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s a minor grievance, sure, but one that can impact people with wide networks &#8212; like those who interact with a range of clients or customers as part of their job, or remote workers who like to be reminded of what far-flung colleagues look like, for instance.<\/p>\n<p>Plus, the gray initial boxes are just aesthetically displeasing.<\/p>\n<p>Vignette is simple to use. The app will scan select fields in your Contacts, including Email (which is used for <a href=\"https:\/\/en.gravatar.com\/\">Gravatar<\/a>), Twitter, Facebook, and the Custom social network field, Instagram. (Instagram is not one of the built-in options in iOS Contacts, unfortunately).<\/p>\n<p><img class=\"vertical alignnone size-large wp-image-1831436\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/05\/vignette-iphone.png?w=340\" alt=\"\" width=\"340\" height=\"680\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/05\/vignette-iphone.png 1326w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/05\/vignette-iphone.png?resize=75,150 75w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/05\/vignette-iphone.png?resize=150,300 150w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/05\/vignette-iphone.png?resize=768,1534 768w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/05\/vignette-iphone.png?resize=340,680 340w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/05\/vignette-iphone.png?resize=25,50 25w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 340px) 100vw, 340px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>You can then choose to update each contact with the photo it finds. In the case of multiple photos, you can pick which you prefer. And you don&#8217;t have to make these updates one-by-one &#8212; you can &#8220;Select All&#8221; to make dozens or even hundreds of updates at once.<\/p>\n<p>If you&#8217;re worried the app won&#8217;t find anything &#8212; or not enough to warrant spending $4.99 &#8212; you can opt to run the scan first, before committing to paying. But if you decide to proceed with the updates, you&#8217;ll need to make the one-time purchase.<\/p>\n<p>There are some third-party utilities for contact management, including those that will update based on social network profile data; but they tend to require you to authenticate with the third-party network in order to pull in the additional content.<\/p>\n<p>Vignette does not. The app instead takes a privacy-minded approach to its work. It doesn&#8217;t require you upload your contacts to its servers, and it only uses the social networks anonymously as opposed to having you log in.<\/p>\n<p>The indie developer behind the app, Casey Liss &#8212; who you might know from\u00a0the\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/atp.fm\/\">Accidental Tech Podcast <\/a>or the video series <a href=\"http:\/\/youtube.caseyliss.com\/\"><em>Casey on Cars<\/em><\/a> &#8212; says he has a few ideas for improving the app in the near-term.<\/p>\n<p><img class=\"vertical  wp-image-1831434 alignright\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/05\/contacts.gif?w=334\" alt=\"\" width=\"190\" height=\"390\" \/>This includes duplicate detection, limiting Vignette&#8217;s scans to select contact groups, and better Facebook integration. (Right now it requires a numeric Facebook ID like fb:\/\/profile\/1234567, which Liss realizes is undesirable).<\/p>\n<p>He also acknowledges that many people are asking for LinkedIn integration.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;That would require login, which I\u2019m currently kind of allergic to, but I\u2019ve gotten enough requests to at least consider it,&#8221; he tells us.<\/p>\n<p>The app was built over three months&#8217; time, and is now launching just days before Apple&#8217;s annual developer conference, WWDC, where it&#8217;s expected we&#8217;ll see updated versions of core apps <a href=\"https:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/news\/articles\/2019-05-06\/apple-wwdc-2019-ios-13-macos-10-15-watchos-6-tvos-features\">including Messages<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Given its singular purpose, Vignette may not have a wide audience. Liss admitted that&#8217;s the case on a recent episode of the Analog(ue) podcast, in fact.<\/p>\n<p>When asked, who the app was for, he responded: &#8220;it&#8217;s for me.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;This is really scratching an itch that I had.

My desk suddenly felt dirty. After assembling the light, I looked around and took inventory of my life and choices. If I was going to have something as lovely as this on my desk, I would have to have a cleaner space. I cleaned up my desk.<\/p>\n<p>[gallery ids=\"1831413,1831417,1831415,1831420,1831419\"]<\/p>\n<h2>Review<\/h2>\n<p>The Dyson Lightcycle is, well, a light. It makes the room brighter. And because it\u2019s made by Dyson, it\u2019s over-engineered and expensive. The Lightcycle is $600 and I&#8217;m not going to attempt to justify it&#8217;s price. I can&#8217;t. This is a product that costs countless times over its utility.<\/p>\n<p><strong>First the good.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>The light works. Hit a button on the top and it turns on. Slide your finger across the top and the light&#8217;s brightness and color temperature changes.<\/p>\n<p>The light is constructed with an insane attention to detail. It\u2019s perfectly balanced. As the light slides up and down its main poll, a counterweight ensures an effortless motion. Likewise the light arm slides back and forth on three large wheels. All awhile, its seemingly wireless with all the connections and wires hidden throughout the mechanisms.<\/p>\n<p>The Dyson Task light is beautiful. It\u2019s impossible to look at the light and not be impressed by the construction. The function of the design is perfect for my desk. I placed it in the center of my workspace and the long arms allows it to reach where ever it&#8217;s needed.<\/p>\n<p>The light works great and thanks to adjustable color temperatures, works in every situation. There are two touch-sensitive bars on top of the unit. Just slide a fingertip across the bars to make the light brighter or change the color temp. Dyson took the light temperatures option to the next level. The owner can connect the lamp to a smartphone app through Bluetooth, and when the light is connected, it will sync the color temp to the idea setting to match the owner\u2019s location on Earth. It\u2019s a clever function and is said to have a host of mental and physical benefits.<\/p>\n<p>According to Dyson, this lamp\u2019s LED unit is good for 60 years thanks to a heat pipe system. It\u2019s said to pull the excess heat generated by the LED away from the unit, ensuring it lasts as long as possible.<\/p>\n<p><strong>And now the bad.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>This lamp costs $600. That\u2019s a hard sell. There are countless minimalist task lamps on the market. None have all the features found on the Dyson Lightcycle but one could argue that a person doesn\u2019t need all of the features.<\/p>\n<p>I found the light produced by the Lightcycle adequate. The intensity is adjustable and there\u2019s even a supercharged mode that turns the intensity up to 11 \u2014 but that\u2019s only accessible through the smartphone companion app. To me, when you need extra light, you need it immediately and not after the 30 seconds needed to use an app.<\/p>\n<p>The Lightcycle&#8217;s main selling point is the automatic adjustable color temperature. It&#8217;s a lovely feature and my eyes feel after using this lamp. Just to be clear, there are a lot of products on the market for much less than the Lightcycle that can replicate the ideal color temperature. Get one. They&#8217;re a great gadget to have around in the winter months.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Bottom line<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>I can&#8217;t recommend a person spends $600 on a light.

Since taking my first VC role in 2012, I\u2019ve seen more change in the past year than all other years combined.<\/p>\n<p>Six years after <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https:\/\/crunchbase.com\/person\/ellen-pao\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"person\" data-entity=\"ellen-pao\">Ellen Pao\u2019s <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"><\/span><\/a> landmark gender discrimination case against Kleiner Perkins Caufield &amp; Byers, Mary Meeker announced her departure to start a new fund with three other KPCB investors. Arlan Hamilton from Backstage Capital graced the cover of Fast Company with the caption \u201c<em>Venture Catalyst.\u201d<\/em> AllRaise\u2019s circulation of a growing list of job postings is regularly hitting the inboxes of female investment talent climbing the check-writing ranks. To quote Seth Godin, &#8220;When you put the right idea into the world, people can&#8217;t unsee it.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>What does it mean to have a seat at the table, and how many of us have needed to bring our own chairs rather than wait for someone to offer us one?<\/p>\n<p>Here are a few reflections on what having a seat at the investors\u2019 table means to me:<\/p>\n<p><strong>Representation is a competitive advantage.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Venture has operated in many ways like a club since its inception, where deals are shared within small, private circles, often comprised of people with more in common than not. When investment decisions are made by people who are not representative of our population \u2014 instead representative of the interests of a very small percentage of the population (in ethnicity, culture, education, and socioeconomic status) \u2014 our economy suffers. In other words, fewer wants and needs are addressed by the goods and services in the market, creating less economic prosperity as a whole.<\/p>\n<p>According to the NVCA and Pitchbook, the total investment into venture-backed companies reached $57 billion in just the first half of 2018. To put this into context, <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/List_of_countries_by_GDP_%28nominal%29\">$57 billion is more than 114 countries can claim in GDP<\/a>. Given just how much money is invested \u2014 an increasing figure each year as more venture money appears from new participants \u2014 we should be concerned that <a href=\"https:\/\/www.allraise.org\/data\/\">just 9% of U.S. VCs are women<\/a> despite comprising 50.8% of the U.S. population and driving 70-80% of all consumer purchasing.<\/p>\n<p>#ANGELS and Carta exposed a staggering new statistic that just 9% of company equity is held by women, despite women comprising 33% of the founder and employee workforce.<\/p>\n<p>The private and public markets are waking up to the realization that representation matters. A\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.mckinsey.com\/business-functions\/organization\/our-insights\/why-diversity-matters\" data-saferedirecturl=\"https:\/\/www.google.com\/url?q=https:\/\/www.mckinsey.com\/business-functions\/organization\/our-insights\/why-diversity-matters&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1558636885659000&amp;usg=AFQjCNEV9Z4mcLpmL20IyXraTMkNEh6dfA\">2015 McKinsey study<\/a>\u00a0found that \u201ccompanies in the top quartile for racial and ethnic diversity are 35 percent more likely to have financial returns above their respective national industry medians.\u201d I\u2019m in constant communication with a wide range of investors from established firms to new ones, and the feedback is overwhelmingly positive &#8212; having an investment team more representative of the population generates better deal flow. I have this conversation on a biweekly basis and know that the next generation of investors is watching to see what established VC firms are doing to remain competitive.<\/p>\n<p>So, you ask, what\u2019s next for venture capital?<\/p>\n<p><strong>Assimilation is a thing of the past.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>I tried to blend in as much as possible when I first entered the venture world, not wanting to draw attention to the fact that I came from a very different background than the people I was interacting with. I didn\u2019t know what ski week was, my parents didn\u2019t belong to private clubs, and Ivy League schools were a distant concept. Yet, I found common ground with my new social circle because they were, in many respects, regular people with \u201caccess\u201d broadly defined as the primary differentiator.<\/p>\n<p>Fast forward to today, I see the greatest opportunity for those who are boldly unique. A seat at the table means I can be myself and draw upon my unique experiences to make decisions and support my portfolio companies in a way that only I can. Our industry thrives when contrarian views are developed over time and implemented without compromise. Conformity is the main villain when we decide to settle for the familiar, ultimately generating stagnant venture returns. After all, venture capital is, by definition, meant to be a high-risk asset class.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Safe environments matter. Full stop.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Having a seat at the table means I get to draw the line when male investors, entrepreneurs, and other industry voices choose to transgress or act inappropriately. I feel safe in assuming the male leadership I choose to invest in will have a lower probability of ruining their company due to issues with workplace culture and sexual abuse allegations.<\/p>\n<p>As we witness one industry giant topple after another, spanning film and media, consumer brands, and investors, it has become increasingly apparent that poor judgment calls and mistreatment of talent will no longer be swept under the rug. I occasionally have meetings with entrepreneurs and fellow investors where you could say my \u201cstranger danger\u201d alarms are triggered by off-color comments and malapropos gestures. These are the instances where I will choose to avoid a situation or pass on a business opportunity that could, in time, become a ticking time bomb and, long-term, a poor investment.<\/p>\n<p><strong>There are no more rules.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>A close friend in VC often states, \u201cThe new rule is: there are no rules.\u201d This means new people arriving to the table, chair in hand, to direct investment decisions, whether top-down as a company builder or bottoms-up as a content creator and micro-influencer. No rules means new faces showing up as limited partners in VC funds, and new managers of VC funds sharing their own unique stories of building their less-conventional careers. No rules also means that VC firms are going to look, act, and feel different, throwing out convention in favor of creativity and inclusivity.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Build it and they will come.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Arlan Hamilton of <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https:\/\/crunchbase.com\/organization\/backstage-capital\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"backstage-capital\">Backstage Capital <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"><\/span><\/a> said it best during her 36|86 AMA in Nashville with The JumpFund: \u201cWe will make our own club!\u201d I nearly fell out of my seat applauding, laughing, and cheering. My own interpretation of this statement has to do with the can-do energy that is showing up in venture. In 2018, we are no longer waiting for someone to save a seat for us at the table or invite us into the room at all. We are showing up with our own chairs, building new tables, and creating new spaces and environments that foster the exchanging of ideas and deal docs.<\/p>\n<p>Early in 2018, I set out to learn more about the startup and venture capital landscape in my new home city of Nashville, Tennessee, and in the broader surrounding geography of the Southeastern U.S. I quickly found that the entrepreneurs and investors I met were surprised by me &#8212; a relatively young, half-Mexican, female face did not immediately trigger the words \u2018venture\u2019 and \u2018capital\u2019.<\/p>\n<p>Questions followed, such as, \u201cHow did you end up in venture capital?\u201d and statements like, \u201cPeople must tell you all of the time that you don\u2019t look like the typical VC.\u201d A few minutes into the conversation and those questions and statements dissipate, though I knew there must be a broader local community sharing my interests and lack of conformity in physical appearance and style. So, I set out and launched ModernCapital to make the venture capital industry more accessible to new talent. Our team of 4 (3 venture fellows plus myself) is 100% female and 50% Latina. As we spend more time digging into the entrepreneurial landscape of our region, more entrepreneurs and future investors from a wide range of backgrounds are contacting us wanting to join the community we are building.<\/p>\n<p>Considering just how much has changed in the dialogue around venture capital and where the greatest next investment opportunities will arise, I am confident this is only the beginning.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Monique Villa Contributor Share on Twitter Monique Villa is an investor at Mucker Capital, a seed and \u201cpre-seed\u201d stage fund investing in companies powering a software-enabled world.

Battery-powered cars would leave as frequently as every 30 seconds, with a journey time of just 15 minutes in either direction. In the future, Musk even envisages converting the tunnels into a Hyperloop system outfitted with pods that could theoretically reach speeds of 600 mph.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If the Baltimore-to-DC Loop system is considered a road tunnel, it would be the longest in the world. As a rail tunnel, it would only be surpassed by the epic Gotthard Base Tunnel running beneath the Swiss Alps.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But where the Gotthard Base Tunnel has escape passageways spaced about every 1,000 feet, Musk\u2019s Loop will have up to 10,500 feet between emergency exits. That is more than four times the maximum distance permitted in standards set by the <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.nfpa.org\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">National Fire Protection Association<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> (NFPA) for public rail and transit systems.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cJust because a vehicle doesn\u2019t have gasoline doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s not a significant fire risk,\u201d said Glenn Corbett, a professor of security, fire and emergency management at the John Jay College of Criminal Justice in New York. \u201cLithium-ion batteries are perhaps even more dangerous, and have been an issue for airlines and fire safety agencies for the last 10 years.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Modern electric vehicle batteries can suffer <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2018\/06\/26\/tesla-model-s-battery-re-ignited-twice-after-fatal-florida-crash-says-ntsb\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">intense, runaway fires when damaged<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.

Tesla said this month that it was <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2019\/05\/15\/tesla-issues-battery-software-update-after-hong-kong-vehicle-fire\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">updating its vehicles\u2019 battery software<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> for charging and thermal management. \u201cAlthough fire incidents involving Tesla vehicles are already extremely rare and our cars are 10 times less likely to experience a fire than a gas car, we believe the right number of incidents to aspire to is zero,\u201d it wrote in a statement. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Loop document says that TBC will install fire detection, suppression and safety measures as well as a powerful ventilation system. But the facilities for passengers to escape during an emergency, be it breakdown, fire, flooding or terrorism, leave much to be desired, says Corbett: \u201cYou\u2019ll have people that range from 5 years old to 95. What they\u2019re proposing now would certainly not pass muster.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span class=\"embed-youtube embed breakout embed--video\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe class='youtube-player' type='text\/html' width='640' height='360' src='https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/WDpRraceweI?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;autohide=2&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;'><\/iframe><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For a start, some of the Loop\u2019s emergency exits are too far apart. Should a fire break out at the worst possible place, passengers could face a two-mile walk to an exit &#8212; and then up to another quarter of a mile to a ventilation shaft leading to the surface. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To comply with NFPA standards for rail tunnels, the Loop would need at least 74 such exits for each of the twin tunnels between Baltimore and DC. TBC\u2019s document says it only intends to build \u201cup to 70\u201d in total.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If the Loop system were designated a road tunnel instead, complying would be even harder. Stricter NFPA standards for car and truck tunnels mean that TBC would have to construct more than 180 exit shafts for each tunnel. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cEven this standard, which is 1,000 feet between exits, is fairly weak,\u201d Corbett said. \u201cSmoke from a fire in an enclosed, below-grade area has a high propensity to kill people and create a lot of problems.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><b>The \u2018definition of insanity\u2019<\/b><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When passengers eventually reach the ventilation shafts, their problems might not be over. The tunnel floor will be between 44 and 104 feet below the surface. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cOne or more means of vertical access (e.g. elevator, man basket, stairs or ladder) would be provided for ingress\/egress,\u201d states TBC\u2019s document. At the top of each shaft will be either a shed housing ventilation equipment, or a flat steel grate. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cThat\u2019s not going to work,\u201d Corbett said. \u201cYou\u2019re telling me a 70-year-old grandmother who\u2019s just traveled thousands of feet is going to climb a ladder to get out? That\u2019s crazy. It\u2019s the definition of insanity.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Such long and inconvenient escape routes would also hamper incoming firefighters, who typically have only a 30-minute supply of air for their breathing apparatus. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cIngress becomes a concern with very long tunnels,\u201d said Justin Edenbaum, a tunnel fire and ventilation engineering consultant based in Toronto, Canada. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Another issue is that long tunnels are rare in the United States, a country that has more experience with fires in tall buildings than deep underground.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cAll of our research in terms of stairwells has been done with downward motion,\u201d Corbett explained. \u201cWhat\u2019s not been well studied are situations where people might have to walk a significant distance to get to a stairwell and then climb out. This is going to require a significant amount of research and consideration.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>A different approach<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Where long transit tunnels have been built recently, in Europe and Asia, engineers have taken a different approach. Instead of widely separated staircases, frequent cross-passageways allow passengers to quickly escape fire or smoke into either a dedicated safety tunnel or the tunnel traveling in the other direction. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In 2016, Jae-Ho Pyeon, a professor of civil and environmental engineering at San Jose State University, conducted a <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/transweb.sjsu.edu\/research\/trend-analysis-long-tunnels-worldwide\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">trend analysis of long tunnels around the world<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. He found that the majority of long rail tunnels globally have such crossover connections, and that all built in the last decade have exits spaced far closer than 2,500 feet.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Pyeon concluded: \u201cConfigurations connected by cross passages are becoming more popular, mainly due to increasingly demanding safety requirements.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">2015 study<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> by Edenbaum found that not only do cross passages enable people to escape a smoky environment faster than stairways, they also let firefighters reach the blaze earlier, and can dramatically reduce construction costs.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>The Boring Company&#8217;s take<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Boring Company did not respond to detailed questions about the Loop system but told TechCrunch that it had been designed to be the safest public transportation system in the world, which includes compliance with applicable safety and fire protection standards.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the absence of federal rules for transit tunnels, the Loop will be subject to the regulations of the jurisdictions it passes beneath. Existing subway systems in Baltimore, Washington, D.C. and Maryland are all required to follow NFPA standards. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Curiously, TBC has yet to discuss its flagship project with Maryland\u2019s fire agency. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cWhile the Office of the State Fire Marshal hasn&#8217;t been contacted by The Boring Company in regards to the proposed [Loop system], we would take the position of applying our standard underground subway safety standards to such a project to ensure the safety of everyone involved,\u201d said Maryland State Fire Marshal Brian Geraci.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">That being said, there is a slight chance that TBC would not be forced to include more shafts or emergency passages.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201c[The NFPA standard states that] you can suggest solutions that are equivalent or superior to the stated methods, but they have to be approved the authority having jurisdiction,\u201d says Edenbaum. \u201c[TBC] may have an argument about how it can go as widely spaced as it wants. They could make the case that [the Loop] is safer than a highway. That\u2019s a risk-based assessment, which is not very popular in North America, but it\u2019s another way to look at it.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The draft environmental assessment is currently in its public comment phase, along with a draft agreement between TBC and various federal agencies regarding the Loop\u2019s impact on historical properties. There are also numerous other <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.permits.performance.gov\/permitting-projects\/dc-baltimore-loop-tunnel-project\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">permits and approvals<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> that will be necessary before TBC completes a detailed design and starts digging, including safety assessments.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">TBC has also proposed projects in other parts of the country with varying success. The one closest to getting underway this year is in <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/us-news\/2019\/may\/17\/las-vegas-is-about-to-take-a-gamble-on-musks-boring-company\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Las Vegas<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, where TBC has proposed building a high-speed underground transit system that would initially transport people around the Las Vegas Convention Center.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The upshot: For all of Elon Musk\u2019s obsession with speed, the world\u2019s longest tunnel won\u2019t be arriving anytime soon. <\/span><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The Boring Company\u2019s Loop transit system that aims to shuttle people in autonomous electric vehicles between Baltimore and Washington, D.C. fails to meet several key national safety standards, a review of its proposal reveals.

If you don&#8217;t manage it efficiently, you go out of business.&#8221; Other solutions can look ugly to customers, forcibly restrict bartenders, or take time and money to install and maintain.

While a little quicker, that&#8217;s very subjective and in-accurate More advanced systems see every bottled weighed to see exactly how much is left. If they&#8217;re lucky, the scale connects to a computer, but they still have to punch in what brand of booze they&#8217;re sizing up. But the process can take many hours, which amounts to costly labor and infrequent data. None of these methods eliminate the manual measurement process or give real-time pour info.<\/p>\n<p>So with $6 million in funding, <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2017\/05\/11\/nectar-launches-ultrasound-equipped-pour-spouts-to-save-bar-owners-money\/\">Nectar launched<\/a> in 2017 with its sonar bottle caps that look and operate like old-school pourers. When bars order them, they come pre-synced and labeled for certain bottle shapes like Petron or Jack Daniels. Their Bluetooth batteries last a year and connect wirelessly to a base hub in the bar. With each pour, the sonar pulse determines how much is in the bottle and subtracts it from the previous measurement to record how much was doled out. And the startup&#8217;s new gyroscopic beer system is calibrated to deduce pour volume from the angle and time the tap is depressed without the need for a sensor to be installed (and repaired) inside the beer hose.<\/p>\n<p>Bar managers can keep any eye on everything throughout the night with desktop, iOS, and Android apps. They could instantly tell if a martini special is working based on how much gin across brands is being poured, ask bartenders to slow their pours if they&#8217;re creeping upwards in volume, or give the green light to strong pours on weeknights to reward regular customers. &#8220;Some bars encourage overpours to get people to keep coming back&#8221; says local San Francisco celebrity bartender Broke-Ass Stuart, who tells me pre-measured pourers can save owners money but cost servers tips.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/getnectar.com\/products\">Nectar now sells self-serve subscriptions<\/a> to its hardware and software, with a 20 cap package costing $99 per month billed annually with free yearly replacements. It&#8217;s also got a free 2 tap trial package, or a $399 per month enterprise subscription for 100 taps. Nectar is designed to complement bar point of sale systems. And if a bar just wants the software, Nectar just launched its PrecisionAudit app where staff tap the current liquid level on a photo of each different bottle for more accurate eyeballing. It&#8217;s giving a discount rate of $29.99 per month on the first 1000 orders.<img class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-1831383\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/05\/nectar-precision-audit.png?w=680\" alt=\"\" width=\"680\" height=\"574\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/05\/nectar-precision-audit.png 1154w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/05\/nectar-precision-audit.png?resize=150,127 150w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/05\/nectar-precision-audit.png?resize=300,253 300w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/05\/nectar-precision-audit.png?resize=768,648 768w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/05\/nectar-precision-audit.png?resize=680,574 680w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/05\/nectar-precision-audit.png?resize=50,42 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>After 2 million pours measured, the business is growing 200 percent quarter-over-quarter as bowling alley chains and stadiums sign up for pilots. The potential to change the booze business seduced investors like Tinder co-founders Sean Rad and Justin Mateen, Palantir co-founder Joe Lonsdale, and the founding family of the Modelo beer company. Next, Nectar is trying to invent a system for wine. That&#8217;s trickier since its taps would need to be able to suck the air out of the bottles each night.<\/p>\n<p>The big challenge will be convincing bars to change after tracking inventory the same way for decades. No one wants to deal with technical difficulties in a jam-packed bar. That&#8217;s partly why Nectar&#8217;s subscription doesn&#8217;t force owners to buy its hardware up front.<\/p>\n<p>fIf Nectar can nail not only the tech but the bartender experience, it could pave a smoother path to hospitality entrepreneurship. Alcohol shrinkage is one factor leading to the rapid demise of many bars and restaurants. Plus, it could liberate bartenders from measuring bottles into the wee hours.

It&#8217;s really important to recognize that sexism and racism themselves are historical phenomena.<\/p>\n<p>They don&#8217;t exist in the same way in all places. They take on different forms at different times. I find that very hopeful to recognize, because it means they can change.<\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s really important not to get too pulled into the view that men have always hated women there will always be this war of the sexes that, best case scenario, gets temporarily resolved in the depressing truce of conventional heterosexuality. \u00a0The conditions we live under are not the only possible conditions\u2014they are not inevitable.<\/p>\n<p>A fundamental Marxist insight is that capitalism necessarily involves exploitation. In order to grow, a company needs to pay people less for their work than that work is worth. Race and gender help make this process of exploitation seem natural.<\/p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_1831321\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-1831321\" class=\"breakout size-full wp-image-1831321\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/05\/GettyImages-1013919170.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/05\/GettyImages-1013919170.jpg 6000w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/05\/GettyImages-1013919170.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/05\/GettyImages-1013919170.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/05\/GettyImages-1013919170.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/05\/GettyImages-1013919170.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/05\/GettyImages-1013919170.jpg?resize=50,33 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><p id=\"caption-attachment-1831321\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Image via Getty Images \/ gremlin<\/p><\/div><\/p>\n<p>Certain people are naturally inclined to do certain kinds of lower status and lower waged work, and why should anyone be paid much to do what comes naturally? And it just so happens that the kinds of work we value less are seen as more naturally \u201cfemale.\u201d This isn\u2019t just about caring professions that have been coded female\u2014nursing and teaching and so on, although it <i>does<\/i> include those.<\/p>\n<p>In fact, the history of computer programming provides one of the best examples. In the early decades, when writing software was seen as rote work and lower status, it was mostly done by women. As Mar Hicks and other historians have shown, as the profession became more prestigious and more lucrative, women were very actively pushed out.<\/p>\n<p>You even see this with specific coding languages. As more women learn, say, Javascript, it becomes seen as <i>feminized<\/i>\u2014seen as less impressive or valuable than Python, a \u201csofter\u201d skill. This perception, that women have certain natural capacities that should be free or cheap, has a long history that overlaps with the history of capitalism. \u00a0At some level, it is a byproduct of the rise of wage labor.<\/p>\n<p>To a medieval farmer it would have made no sense to say that when his wife had their children who worked their farm, gave birth to them in labor, killed the chickens and cooked them, or did work around the house, that that wasn&#8217;t \u201cwork,\u201d [but when he] took the chickens to the market to sell them, that was. Right?<\/p>\n<p>A long line of feminist thinkers has drawn attention to this in different ways. One slogan from the 70s was, &#8216;whose work produces the worker?&#8217; Women, but neither companies nor the state, who profit from this process, expect to pay for it.<\/p>\n<p>Why am I saying all this? My point is: race and gender have been very useful historically for getting capitalism things for free\u2014and for <i>justifying<\/i> that process. Of course, they\u2019re also very useful for dividing exploited people against one another.

Once it has been shut down, access to the Discover section will no longer be available. Games downloaded that appear in Play, may still function if they do not require a purchase validation upon launch.

On the one hand, it means there&#8217;s a healthy base of potential subscribers for new services. But it also means that many people may only adopt a new subscription by dropping another &#8212; perhaps to maintain their current budget.<\/p>\n<p>Subscriptions, after all, may still feel like luxuries. No one <em>needs<\/em> Netflix, Spotify, groceries delivered to their home or curated clothing selections sent by mail, for example. There are non-subscription alternatives that are much more affordable. The question is which luxuries are worth the recurring bill?<\/p>\n<p>The survey, however, did not define subscription services, which could include news and magazine subscriptions, digital streaming services, subscription box services, and more. But it did ask about consumers&#8217; interest in the various categories.<\/p>\n<p>Over half of U.S. consumers (57%) said they were interested in TV and video-on-demand services (like Netflix) and 38 percent were interested in music services.<\/p>\n<p>Related to this, eMarketer forecasts U.S. over-the-top video viewers will top 193 million by 2021, or 57.3 percent of the population. Digital audio listeners will top 211 million by the same time, or 63.1 percent of the population.<\/p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-1831303\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/05\/Digital-Audio-Listeners.png?w=680\" alt=\"\" width=\"680\" height=\"613\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/05\/Digital-Audio-Listeners.png 1020w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/05\/Digital-Audio-Listeners.png?resize=150,135 150w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/05\/Digital-Audio-Listeners.png?resize=300,271 300w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/05\/Digital-Audio-Listeners.png?resize=768,693 768w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/05\/Digital-Audio-Listeners.png?resize=680,613 680w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/05\/Digital-Audio-Listeners.png?resize=50,45 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>The next most popular subscriptions in the survey were grocery delivery like AmazonFresh (32%) and meal delivery like Blue Apron (21%).\u00a0Software and storage services like iCloud and subscription beauty services like Ipsy followed, each with 17 percent.<\/p>\n<p>Consumers were less interested in subscription news and information and subscription boxes &#8212; the latter only saw 10 percent interest, in fact.<\/p>\n<p>The figures should be taken with a grain of salt, of course.

investigation into its processing of personal data in the context of its online Ad Exchange, TechCrunch has learnt.<\/p>\n<p>This follows a privacy complaint pertaining to adtech&#8217;s real-timing bidding (RTB) system filed under Europe&#8217;s GDPR framework last year.<\/p>\n<p>The statutory inquiry into Google&#8217;s adtech that&#8217;s being opened by the Irish Data Protection Commission (DPC), cites section 110 of Ireland&#8217;s Data Protection Act 2018, which means that the watchdog suspects infringement &#8212; and will now investigate its suspicions.<\/p>\n<p>The DPC writes that the inquiry is &#8220;to establish whether processing of personal data carried out at each stage of an advertising transaction is in compliance with the relevant provisions of the General Data Protection Regulation, including the lawful basis for processing, the principles of transparency and data minimisation, as well as Google&#8217;s retention practices&#8221;.<\/p>\n<p>We&#8217;ve reached out to Google for comment.\u00a0<strong>Update:\u00a0<\/strong>A Google spokesperson said: \u201cWe will engage fully with the DPC\u2019s investigation and welcome the opportunity for further clarification of Europe\u2019s data protection rules for real-time bidding. Authorised buyers using our systems are subject to stringent policies and standards.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>As we reported <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2019\/05\/20\/gdpr-adtech-complaints-keep-stacking-up-in-europe\/\">earlier this week<\/a> complaints about the RTB system used by online advertisers have been stacking up across Europe.<\/p>\n<p>The relevant complaint in this instance was lodged last fall by Dr <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https:\/\/crunchbase.com\/person\/johnny-ryan\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" data-type=\"person\" data-entity=\"johnny-ryan\">Johnny Ryan <\/a>of\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2018\/06\/20\/blockchain-browser-brave-starts-opt-in-testing-of-on-device-ad-targeting\/\">private browser Brave<\/a>, and alleges \u201cwide-scale and systemic breaches of the data protection regime&#8221; by Google and others in the behavioral advertising industry.<\/p>\n<p>Where Google is concerned the complaint focuses on its DoubleClick\/Authorized Buyers ad system.<\/p>\n<p>In a nutshell, the RTB complaints argue the system is inherently insecure &#8212; and that&#8217;s incompatible with GDPR&#8217;s requirement that personal data is processed \u201cin a manner that ensures appropriate security&#8221;.<\/p>\n<p>Commenting on the Irish DPC opening an inquiry in a statement, Ryan said: &#8220;Surveillance capitalism is about to become obsolete. The Irish Data Protection Commission\u2019s action signals that now &#8212; nearly one year after the GDPR was introduced &#8212; a change is coming that goes beyond just Google. We need to reform online advertising to protect privacy, and to protect advertisers and publishers from legal risk under the GDPR\u201d.<\/p>\n<p>Similar complaints against RTB have been filed in the UK, Poland, Spain, Belgium, Luxembourg and the Netherlands.<\/p>\n<p>Ireland is leading the investigation of Google&#8217;s adtech as the company designates Google Ireland as the data controller for EU users.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"z3DxoVxqqz\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2019\/01\/27\/google-and-iab-ad-category-lists-show-massive-leakage-of-highly-intimate-data-gdpr-complaint-claims\/\">Google and IAB ad category lists show &#8216;massive leakage of highly intimate data,&#8217; GDPR complaint claims<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe title=\"&#8220;Google and IAB ad category lists show &#8216;massive leakage of highly intimate data,&#8217; GDPR complaint claims&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2019\/01\/27\/google-and-iab-ad-category-lists-show-massive-leakage-of-highly-intimate-data-gdpr-complaint-claims\/embed\/#?secret=z3DxoVxqqz\" data-secret=\"z3DxoVxqqz\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Google&#8217;s lead data regulator in Europe has opened a formal investigation into its processing of personal data in the context of its online Ad Exchange, TechCrunch has learnt.

A second resolution would have demanded an independent human and civil rights review into the use of the technology.<\/p>\n<p>It followed accusations that the technology has bias and inaccuracies, which critics say can be used to racially discriminate against minorities.<\/p>\n<p>The votes were non-binding, allowing the company to reject the outcome of the vote.<\/p>\n<p>But the vote was almost inevitably set to fail. Following his divorce, Amazon founder and chief executive <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https:\/\/crunchbase.com\/person\/jeff-bezos\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"person\" data-entity=\"jeff-bezos\">Jeff Bezos <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"><\/span><\/a> retains 12% of the company&#8217;s stock, as well as the voting rights <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2019\/04\/04\/mackenzie-bezos-giving-ex-husband-jeff-75-percent-of-amazon-stock-voting-control\/\">in his ex-wife&#8217;s remaining stake<\/a>. The company&#8217;s top four institutional shareholders, including The Vanguard Group, Blackrock, FMR and State Street, collectively hold about the same amount of voting rights as Bezos.<\/p>\n<p>The resolutions failed despite an effort by the ACLU to back the measures, which the civil liberties group accused the tech giant of being &#8220;non-responsive&#8221; to privacy concerns.<\/p>\n<p>In remarks, Shankar Narayan, ACLU of Washington, said: &#8220;The fact that there needed to be a vote on this is an embarrassment for Amazon&#8217;s leadership team. It demonstrates shareholders do not have confidence that company executives are properly understanding or addressing the civil and human rights impacts of its role in facilitating pervasive government surveillance.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;While we have yet to see the exact breakdown of the vote, this shareholder intervention should serve as a wake-up call for the company to reckon with the real harms of face surveillance and to change course,&#8221; he said.<\/p>\n<p>The civil liberties group <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2019\/05\/20\/amazon-shareholder-pressure-face-recognition\/\">rallied investors<\/a> ahead of the Wednesday annual meeting in Seattle, where the tech giant has its headquarters. In a letter, the group said the sale of Amazon&#8217;s facial recognition tech to government agencies &#8220;fundamentally alters the balance of power between government and individuals, arming governments with unprecedented power to track, control, and harm people.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;As shown by a long history of other surveillance technologies, face surveillance is certain to be disproportionately aimed at immigrants, religious minorities, people of color, activists, and other vulnerable communities,&#8221; the letter added.<\/p>\n<p>The ACLU said investors and shareholders had the power &#8220;to protect Amazon from its own failed judgment.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Amazon <a href=\"https:\/\/aws.amazon.com\/blogs\/aws\/thoughts-on-machine-learning-accuracy\/\">pushed back<\/a> against claims that the technology is inaccurate, and called on the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission to block the shareholder proposal prior to its annual shareholder meeting.

founder Gabriel Weinberg is coming to Disrupt"},"content":{"rendered":"<p id=\"speakable-summary\">2019 is the year Facebook announced a &#8220;pivot to privacy.&#8221; At the same time, Google is trying to claim that privacy means letting it exclusively store and data-mine everything you do online. So what better time to sit down with <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https:\/\/crunchbase.com\/organization\/duck-duck-go\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"duck-duck-go\">DuckDuckGo <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"><\/span><\/a> founder and CEO Gabriel Weinberg for a chat about what privacy <em>really<\/em> means.<\/p>\n<p>We&#8217;re delighted to announce that Weinberg is joining us at Disrupt SF (October 2-4).<\/p>\n<p>The pro-privacy search engine he founded has been on a mission to shrink the shoulder-surfing creepiness of internet searching for more than a decade, serving contextual keyword-based ads, rather than pervasively tracking users to maintain privacy-hostile profiles. (If you can&#8217;t quite believe the decade bit; here&#8217;s DDG&#8217;s startup <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2008\/12\/12\/elevator-pitch-friday-duck-duck-go-the-hybrid-search-engine\/\">elevator pitch<\/a> &#8212; which we featured on TC all the way back in 2008.)<\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s a position that looks increasingly smart as big tech comes under sharper political and regulatory scrutiny on account of the volume of information it&#8217;s amassing. (Not to mention what it&#8217;s doing with people&#8217;s data.)<\/p>\n<p>Despite competing as a self-funded underdog against the biggest tech giants around, DuckDuckGo has been profitable and gaining users at a steady clip for years. It also <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2018\/08\/29\/duckduckgo-gets-10m-from-omers-for-global-privacy-push\/\">recently took in a chunk of VC<\/a> to capitalize on what its investors see as a growing international opportunity to help internet users go about their business without being intrusively snooped on. Which makes a compelling counter narrative to the tech giants.<\/p>\n<p>In more recent developments it has added a <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2018\/01\/23\/duckduckgo-adds-tracker-blocking-to-help-curb-the-wider-surveillance-web\/\">tracker blocker<\/a> to its product mix &#8212; and been dabbling in <a href=\"https:\/\/spreadprivacy.com\/do-not-track-act-2019\/\">policy advocacy<\/a> &#8212; calling for a revival of a Do Not Track browser standard, after earlier attempts floundered with the industry, failing to reach accord.<\/p>\n<p>The political climate around privacy and data protection does look to be pivoting in such a way that Do Not Track could possibly swing back into play. But if &#8212; and, yes it&#8217;s a big one &#8212; privacy ends up being a baked-in internet norm, how might a pioneer like DuckDuckGo maintain its differentiating edge?<\/p>\n<p>While, on the flip side, what if tech giants end up moving in on its territory by redefining privacy in their own self-serving image? We have questions and will be searching Weinberg for answers.<\/p>\n<p>There&#8217;s also the fact that many a founder would have cut and run just half a decade into pushing against the prevailing industry grain. So we&#8217;re also keen to mine his views on entrepreneurial patience, and get a better handle on what makes him tick as a person &#8212; to learn how he&#8217;s turned a passion for building people-centric, principled products into a profitable business.<\/p>\n<p>Disrupt SF runs October 2 &#8211; October 4 at the Moscone Center in San Francisco.

An order is an instruction from them to improve processes within a certain time frame. The order requires us to optimize existing processes to prevent money laundering and increase N26 staffing levels,\u201d the company says in <a href=\"https:\/\/n26.com\/en-de\/blog\/bafin-order-what-it-means-and-what-we-are-doing?utm_source=twitter&amp;medium=social&amp;utm_content=blog-post&amp;utm_term=bafin\">a blog post<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>A <a href=\"https:\/\/t3n.de\/news\/maengel-bei-n26-finanzaufsicht-mahnt-reformen-an-1155446\/\">few<\/a> <a href=\"https:\/\/www.tagesschau.de\/investigativ\/ndr\/geldwaesche-online-101.html\">articles<\/a> have highlighted a handful of cases of fraud in recent weeks. Customers tried to use N26 for money-laundering purposes. It took some time before N26 reacted and closed those accounts.<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s not that surprising given that literally every bank suffers from this issue. For instance, all the big French banks (BNP Paribas, Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole and Cr\u00e9dit Mutuel) <a href=\"https:\/\/www.cbanque.com\/banque\/actualites\/68852\/credit-mutuel-une-amende-pour-manquement-dans-la-lutte-contre-le-blanchiment\">have been fined<\/a> in the past for the same reason.<\/p>\n<p>Banking regulators don\u2019t review suspicious transactions directly. They make sure that banks have the right processes and teams to catch the vast majority of suspicious transactions.<\/p>\n<p>As N26 has more than 2.5 million users, it\u2019s been hard to scale its workforce appropriately. In other words, it has been short-staffed. In recent months, the company has been hiring customer support and anti-money laundering teams like crazy, by hiring more people directly and signing deals with subcontractors.<\/p>\n<p>BaFin asks N26 to catch up with its backlog of flagged transactions. The company plans to be done by the end of next week. BaFin also wants to see written descriptions of processes and workflows. Finally, the regulator says that N26 should recheck the identity of some customers and redo the KYC process (\u201cknow your customer\u201d). N26 says that it plans to implement BaFin\u2019s requirements before the deadline.<\/p>\n<p>Creating a startup is hard, but creating a bank with startup-like growth is even harder. Banking regulation is tough, and it\u2019s a good thing for N26 customers that BaFin is keeping an eye out. Let&#8217;s hope that today&#8217;s order is just a bump in the road.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Fintech startup N26 received an order from BaFin, the German banking regulator.

href=\"https:\/\/www.blog.google\/products\/search\/new-design-google-search\/\">unveiled<\/a> a new look for its mobile search results, which gives sites a way to showcase their own branding instead of looking like every other blue link. Before, the search results were blue and the source &#8212; a publisher&#8217;s site, for example &#8212; would appear below in a smaller, green font. Now, it&#8217;s the publisher who gets top billing. With the refresh, the source for the search result appears on top and includes the site&#8217;s own icon.<\/p>\n<p>The revamp is subtle, but one that will likely please publishers as it gives them a way to stand out. After all, web searchers who are already familiar with the publisher&#8217;s site may choose to click through (or rather, tap through) to their link out of a personal preference &#8212; even if it&#8217;s further down on the results page.<\/p>\n<p>In addition, the website branding can help web searchers better understand where the information is coming from &#8212; like an official site or well-known news publication, for example.<img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-1831219\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/05\/google-mobile-search-results.png?w=571\" alt=\"\" width=\"571\" height=\"680\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/05\/google-mobile-search-results.png 840w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/05\/google-mobile-search-results.png?resize=126,150 126w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/05\/google-mobile-search-results.png?resize=252,300 252w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/05\/google-mobile-search-results.png?resize=768,914 768w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/05\/google-mobile-search-results.png?resize=571,680 571w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/05\/google-mobile-search-results.png?resize=42,50 42w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 571px) 100vw, 571px\" \/>The update also impacts how Google Search ads appear.<\/p>\n<p>Before, the word &#8220;Ad&#8221; would display in a small green box ahead of the source link. Now, the word &#8220;Ad&#8221; appears in a bolded, black font where the website icon would otherwise be. It&#8217;s a bit less noticeable that the top search results link is an ad because your eyes are drawn to the blue link &#8212; and because the word &#8220;Ad&#8221; no longer has a box around it.<\/p>\n<p>Google says the new design will help it prepare for the search changes ahead as it enables the company to add to the search result cards more action buttons and previews, while still retaining attribution back to the source.<\/p>\n<p>The company recently announced at <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/tag\/google-i-o-2019\/\">Google I\/O<\/a> some of its plans for new search features, including <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2019\/05\/07\/google-brings-augmented-reality-to-search\/\">AR in search results<\/a>, as well as <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2019\/05\/07\/google-search-will-offer-better-news-coverage-and-soon-support-for-podcast-search\/\">better news coverage and support for podcast search<\/a>. The latter will offer links to listen right in the search results as well as tools to save the podcast to play later.<\/p>\n<p>In the meantime, site owners and publishers that want to customize their icon for their organic search listings can do so <a href=\"https:\/\/support.google.com\/webmasters\/answer\/9290858\">here<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Google says this new design is rolling out first to mobile users over the next few days.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Google today unveiled a new look for its mobile search results, which gives sites a way to showcase their own branding instead of looking like every other blue link.

TP-Link released a patch a few weeks later for the vulnerable WR940N router, but Mabbitt warned TP-Link again in January 2018 that another router, TP-Link&#8217;s WR740N, was also vulnerable to the same bug because the company <a href=\"https:\/\/fidusinfosec.com\/a-curious-case-of-code-reuse-tplink-cve-2017-13772-v2\/\">reused vulnerable code<\/a> between devices.<\/p>\n<p>TP-Link said the vulnerability was <a href=\"https:\/\/www.tp-link.com\/us\/support\/faq\/2166\/\">quickly patched<\/a> in both routers.

Modifying the settings on the router affects everyone who&#8217;s connected to the same network, like altering the DNS settings to trick users into visiting a fake page to steal their login credentials.<\/p>\n<p>TP-Link declined to disclose how many potentially vulnerable routers it had sold, but said that the WR740N had been discontinued a year earlier in 2017. When we checked two search engines for exposed devices and databases, Shodan and Binary Edge, each suggested there are anywhere between 129,000 and 149,000 devices on the internet \u2014 though the number of vulnerable devices is likely far lower.<\/p>\n<p>Mabbitt said he believed TP-Link still had a duty of care to alert customers of the update if thousands of devices are still vulnerable, rather than hoping they will contact the company&#8217;s tech support.<\/p>\n<p>Both <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2019\/05\/01\/uk-connected-devices-security\/\">the U.K.<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2018\/10\/05\/california-passes-law-that-bans-default-passwords-in-connected-devices\/\">the U.S. state of California<\/a> are set to soon require companies to sell devices with unique default passwords to prevent botnets from hijacking internet-connected devices at scale and using their collective internet bandwidth to knock websites offline.<\/p>\n<p>The Mirai botnet <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2016\/10\/21\/many-sites-including-twitter-and-spotify-suffering-outage\/\">downed<\/a> Dyn, a domain name service giant, which knocked <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2016\/10\/21\/many-sites-including-twitter-and-spotify-suffering-outage\/\">dozens of major sites<\/a> offline for hours \u2014 including Twitter, Spotify and SoundCloud.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Read more:<\/strong><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2019\/05\/01\/uk-connected-devices-security\/\">UK plans new law aimed at improving Internet of Things security<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2018\/10\/05\/california-passes-law-that-bans-default-passwords-in-connected-devices\/\">California passes law that bans default passwords in connected devices<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2016\/10\/21\/many-sites-including-twitter-and-spotify-suffering-outage\/\">Large DDoS attacks cause outages at Twitter, Spotify, and other sites<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2019\/05\/10\/gps-trackers-flaw\/\">A popular GPS tracker leaks real-time locations<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2019\/02\/17\/we-take-your-privacy-and-security-seriously\/\">Stop saying, \u2018We take your privacy and security seriously\u2019<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2018\/12\/10\/equifax-breach-preventable-house-oversight-report\/\">Equifax breach was \u2018entirely preventable\u2019 had it used basic security measures<\/a><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Thousands of TP-Link routers are vulnerable to a bug that can be used to remotely take control of the device, but it took more than a year for the company to publish the patches on its website.
