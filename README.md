# Group Project Kickoff: Wednesday, May 22nd, 2019
## Description
* Your task is to form into teams and build something awesome!
* You'll be using the front-end skills you've developed over the last several weeks.
* Each team must present their project on Thursday, May 30th, 2019
## Technical Requirements
* Implement a Responsive Design that works on Chrome on OSX, iOS devices, and Android devices at 360px, 768px, and 1200+ px wide
* Access at least 2 remote APIs (data mashup!)
* Use fewer than 3 global variables (numerous constants are fine, but should be limited to primitive values like numbers and strings)
* You must host your site on AWS
## Workflow Requirements
* Groups of 2-4 members (Note: your team might be augmented so that no one is building a solo project.)
* Create github repo (add all group members as collaborators)
* Collaborate using PRs (Pull Requests), making sure to tag a reviewer for approval
* Use a feature tracking system, such as:
  * Github repo README.md or Issues
  * Trello
## Suggested PR rejection criteria
* Does not fulfill feature
* Breaks other feature
* Does not follow team's coding style/standards
* Too many commits in a single PR (meaning too much to review)
* Code in a commit does not match commit message
* Commit message is vague
